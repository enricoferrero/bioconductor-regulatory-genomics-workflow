## Abstract

The identification of therapeutic targets is a critical issue in drug discovery, with several programmes failing because of a weak linkage between target and disease.

Genome-wide association studies and large gene expression experiments are providing insights into the biology of several common and complex diseases, but the complexity of transcriptional regulation mechanisms often limit our understanding of how genetic variation can influence changes in gene expression.
Several initiatives in the field of regulatory genomics are aiming to close this gap by systematically identifying and cataloguing regulatory elements such as promoters and enhacersacross different tissues and cell types.

In this Bioconductor workflow, we will explore how different types of regulatory genomic data can be used for the functional interpretation of disease-associated variants and for the prioritisation of gene lists from gene expression experiments.
