abstract = {The GENCODE Consortium aims to identify all gene features in the human genome using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental validation. Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35{\%} of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62{\%} of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. GENCODE 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers.},

@article{Zhang2013,
abstract = {In multicellular organisms, transcription regulation is one of the central mechanisms modelling lineage differentiation and cell-fate determination. Transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations between promoters and their corresponding distal regulatory elements. It is believed that their communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases termed transcription factories in three-dimensional nuclear space. However, the dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging approach using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre-initiation complexes of RNA polymerase II, we explore the transcriptional interactomes of three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and neurosphere stem/progenitor cells. Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40,000 long-range interactions, suggest precise enhancer-promoter associations and delineate cell-type-specific chromatin structures. Analysis of the complex regulatory repertoire shows that there are extensive colocalizations among promoters and distal-acting enhancers. Most of the enhancers associate with promoters located beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that the linear juxtaposition is not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection. Although promoter-enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity, promoters involved in interactions are found to be generally common and mostly active among different cells. Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other in embryonic stem cells, linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene expression. Our study sets the stage for the full-scale dissection of spatial and temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development.},

@article{Fullwood2009,
abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of functional elements in the human genome will require thorough interrogation and comparison of individual human genomes and genomic structures. Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.},

Current chromosome conformation capture techniques do not offer sufficiently high resolution to interrogate these regulatory interactions on a genomic scale. Here we use Capture Hi-C (CHi-C), an adapted genome conformation assay, to examine the long-range interactions of almost 22,000 promoters in 2 human blood cell types. We identify over 1.6 million shared and cell type-restricted interactions spanning hundreds of kilobases between promoters and distal loci. Transcriptionally active genes contact enhancer-like elements, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes interact with previously uncharacterized elements marked by repressive features that may act as long-range silencers. Finally, we show that interacting loci are enriched for disease-associated SNPs, suggesting how distal mutations may disrupt the regulation of relevant genes. This study provides new insights and accessible tools to dissect the regulatory interactions that underlie normal and aberrant gene regulation.},

Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how these loci influence traits is lacking for the majority of loci. Studies of the genetics of gene expression have emerged as a key tool for linking DNA sequence variation to phenotypes. Here, we review recent insights into the molecular nature of regulatory variants and describe their influence on the transcriptome and the proteome. We discuss conceptual advances from studies in model organisms and present examples of complete chains of causality that link individual polymorphisms to changes in gene expression, which in turn result in physiological changes and, ultimately, disease risk.},

Our goal in developing and maintaining GRASP is to provide a user-friendly means for diverse sets of researchers to query reported SNP associations (P ≤ 0.05) with human traits, including methylation and expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies. Therefore, in addition to making the full database available for download, we developed a user-friendly web interface that allows for direct querying of GRASP. We provide details on the use of this web interface and what information may be gleaned from using this interactive option. Additionally, we describe potential uses of GRASP and how the scientific community may benefit from the convenient availability of all SNP association results from GWAS (P ≤ 0.05). We plan to continue updating GRASP with newly published GWAS and increased annotation depth.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

Similarity network fusion (SNF) solves this problem by constructing networks of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying data. For example, to create a comprehensive view of a disease given a cohort of patients, SNF computes and fuses patient similarity networks obtained from each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used SNF to combine mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets. SNF substantially outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.},

We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method for discovering the driving sources of variation in multi-omics data. Our model infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability across data modalities. We applied MOFA to data from 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo responses to a panel of drugs. MOFA automatically discovered the known dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status and trisomy of chromosome 12, as well as previously underappreciated drivers of variation, such as response to oxidative stress. These factors capture key dimensions of patient heterogeneity, including those linked to clinical outcomes. Finally, MOFA handles missing data modalities in subsets of samples, enabling imputation, and the model can identify outlier samples.},

abstract = {High-throughput technologies have revolutionized medical research. The advent of genotyping arrays enabled large-scale genome-wide association studies and methods for examining global transcript levels, which gave rise to the field of “integrative genetics”. Other omics technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, are now often incorporated into the everyday methodology of biological researchers. In this review, we provide an overview of such omics technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics layers. As compared to studies of a single omics type, multi-omics offers the opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies disease.},

abstract = {The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method "Tybalt" after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet." From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific activated expression patterns that would result from genetic changes or treatment effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma is a disease of varying severity and differing disease mechanisms. To date, studies aimed at stratifying asthma into clinically useful phenotypes have produced a number of phenotypes that have yet to be assessed for stability and to be validated in independent cohorts. The aim of this study was to define and validate, for the first time ever, clinically driven asthma phenotypes using two independent, severe asthma cohorts: ADEPT and U-BIOPRED. METHODS: Fuzzy partition-around-medoid clustering was performed on pre-specified data from the ADEPT participants (n = 156) and independently on data from a subset of U-BIOPRED asthma participants (n = 82) for whom the same variables were available. Models for cluster classification probabilities were derived and applied to the 12-month longitudinal ADEPT data and to a larger subset of the U-BIOPRED asthma dataset (n = 397). High and low type-2 inflammation phenotypes were defined as high or low Th2 activity, indicated by endobronchial biopsies gene expression changes downstream of IL-4 or IL-13. RESULTS: Four phenotypes were identified in the ADEPT (training) cohort, with distinct clinical and biomarker profiles. Phenotype 1 was "mild, good lung function, early onset", with a low-inflammatory, predominantly Type-2, phenotype. Phenotype 2 had a "moderate, hyper-responsive, eosinophilic" phenotype, with moderate asthma control, mild airflow obstruction and predominant Type-2 inflammation. Phenotype 3 had a "mixed severity, predominantly fixed obstructive, non-eosinophilic and neutrophilic" phenotype, with moderate asthma control and low Type-2 inflammation. Phenotype 4 had a "severe uncontrolled, severe reversible obstruction, mixed granulocytic" phenotype, with moderate Type-2 inflammation. These phenotypes had good longitudinal stability in the ADEPT cohort. They were reproduced and demonstrated high classification probability in two subsets of the U-BIOPRED asthma cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on the biology of the four clinical independently-validated easy-to-assess ADEPT asthma phenotypes will help understanding the unmet need and will aid in developing tailored therapies.

abstract = {Development of hematopoietic populations through the process of differentiation is critical for proper hematopoiesis. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP$\alpha$) is a master regulator of myeloid differentiation, and the identification of C/EBP$\alpha$ target genes is key to understand this process. Here we identified the Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 2B (EVI2B) gene as a direct target of C/EBP$\alpha$. We showed that the product of the gene, the transmembrane glycoprotein EVI2B (CD361), is abundantly expressed on the surface of primary hematopoietic cells, the highest levels of expression being reached in mature granulocytes. Using shRNA-mediated downregulation of EVI2B in human and murine cell lines and in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we demonstrated impaired myeloid lineage development and altered progenitor functions in EVI2B-silenced cells. We showed that the compromised progenitor functionality in Evi2b-depleted cells can be in part explained by deregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, we generated an Evi2b knockout murine model and demonstrated altered properties of hematopoietic progenitors, as well as impaired G-CSF dependent myeloid colony formation in the knockout cells. Remarkably, we found that EVI2B is significantly downregulated in human acute myeloid leukemia samples characterized by defects in CEBPA. Altogether, our data demonstrate that EVI2B is a downstream target of C/EBP$\alpha$, which regulates myeloid differentiation and functionality of hematopoietic progenitors.},

Leptin consumption in the synovial cavity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reported to have protective effect against erosion. To determine the difference in serum leptin and synovial/serum leptin ratio between RA and control and to assess whether these parameters correlate with systemic inflammation in RA. Also, the hypothesis that synovial/serum leptin ratio could be linked to joint erosion in RA was evaluated. The study subjects consisted of 40 consecutive patients with RA, 30 patients of them had knee effusion, and 30 controls. Ten of these controls had acute knee injury and their synovial fluid was obtained for comparison of synovial/serum leptin ratio with patients with RA. The mean serum leptin in patients with RA was significantly higher than controls. Also, the synovial leptin and synovial/serum leptin ratio in the RA patients with effusion was significantly higher than in the 10 control subjects with traumatic effusion. Serum leptin in the 30 RA patients with effusion was higher than the matched synovial leptin. In RA patients with effusion, synovial/serum leptin ratio was also significantly higher in RA patients with erosion than RA patients without erosion. Serum leptin level and synovial/serum leptin ratio are significantly correlated with the RA duration, DAS28, ESR, CRP, TNF-$\alpha$, and IL-6. Finally, in regression analysis, only the synovial/serum leptin ratio was positively associated with erosion in patients with RA. In RA, there is a significant increase in circulating leptin levels and synovial/serum leptin ratio compared to non-RA controls. Serum leptin and synovial/serum leptin ratio are significantly in erosive RA than non-erosive RA. Both parameters are correlated with disease duration and parameters of RA activity. In regression analysis, only the synovial/serum leptin ratio was positively associated with erosion in patients with RA. These results indicate that local consumption of leptin in the joint cavity has a protective role against the destructive course of RA.},

abstract = {Leptin, the adipocyte-produced hormone that plays a key role in body weight homeostasis, has recently been found to be involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Moreover, reciprocal interactions between leptin and glucocorticoids have been described. In the present communication, two different strategies were undertaken to explore the mode of action of leptin in the direct control of rat adrenal function. First, a synthetic peptide approach demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of leptin on basal and ACTH-stimulated corticosterone secretion in vitro is, at least partially, mapped to a domain of the native protein between amino acids 116 and 130, i.e. an area of the molecule also relevant in terms of regulation of food intake and endocrine control. Secondly, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated a complex pattern of adrenal leptin receptor (Ob-R) mRNA expression, with predominant expression of the Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb isoforms, as well as moderate levels of the Ob-Rc and Ob-Rf variants, whereas negligible signals for the Ob-Re isoform were detected. Interestingly, such an expression pattern appeared hormonally regulated as exposure to human recombinant leptin (10(-7 )M) or ACTH (10(-7 )M) significantly decreased Ob-R isoform mRNA expression. Indeed, dose-dependent ligand-induced Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb mRNA down-regulation was further confirmed by adrenal stimulation with increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-5 )M) of the active leptin fragment, leptin 116-130 amide. Overall, our results provide evidence for a novel regulatory step at the level of Ob-R mRNA expression in the interplay between ACTH and leptin for the tuning of rat adrenal corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, our data showing down-regulation of Ob-R mRNA expression by its cognate ligand may well be relevant to leptin physiology and its alteration in various disease states.},

abstract = {Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue in direct proportion to amount of body fat. The circulating leptin levels serve as a gauge of energy stores, thereby directing the regulation of energy homeostasis, neuroendocrine function, and metabolism. Persons with congenital deficiency are obese, and treatment with leptin results in dramatic weight loss through decreased food intake and possible increased energy expenditure. However, most obese persons are resistant to the weight-reducing effects of leptin. Recent studies suggest that leptin is physiologically more important as an indicator of energy deficiency, rather than energy excess, and may mediate adaptation by driving increased food intake and directing neuroendocrine function to converse energy, such as inducing hypothalamic hypogonadism to prevent fertilization. Current studies investigate the role of leptin in weight-loss management because persons who have recently lost weight have relative leptin deficiency that may drive them to regain weight. Leptin deficiency is also evident in patients with diet- or exercise-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea and lipoatrophy. Replacement of leptin in physiologic doses restores ovulatory menstruation in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea and improves metabolic dysfunction in patients with lipoatrophy, including lipoatrophy associated with HIV or highly active antiretroviral therapy. The applications of leptin continue to grow and will hopefully soon be used therapeutically.},

abstract = {Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-9 (Siglec-9) is a novel sialic acid-binding member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is broadly expressed on immune cells, which can inhibit both innate and adaptive immune responses through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. However, the exact role of Siglec-9 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. In this study, we determined soluble Siglec-9 (sSiglec-9) levels in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA and evaluated the relation between sSiglec-9 levels and clinical factors. In addition, we investigated whether Siglec-9 could alleviate collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) development in mice and explored the molecular mechanisms involved. The results showed that, in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA, sSiglec-9 levels were elevated. Thus, high sSiglec-9 serum levels associated with disease severity in patients with RA. Furthermore, administration of recombinant human Siglec-9 Fc chimera protein significantly attenuated collagen-induced arthritis development in vivo and in vitro by reciprocal regulation of the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. Our findings collectively indicate that Siglec-9 plays a potent immunosuppressive role in the pathogenesis of RA by reciprocal regulation of Th17-/Treg-cell differentiation. In conclusion, Siglec-9 may serve as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for RA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the effects of soluble sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (sSiglec)-9 on joint inflammation and destruction in a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and in monolayer cultures of murine macrophages (RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS DBA/1J mice were immunized with type II collagen. Effects of sSiglec-9 were evaluated using a physiologic arthritis score, histological analysis, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ concentration, and the proportion of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-positive regulatory T (Treg) cells. In vivo biofluorescence imaging was used to assess the distribution of sSiglec-9. Levels of M1 (TNF-$\alpha$, interleukin [IL]-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and M2 (CD206, Arginase-1, and IL-10) macrophage markers and phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules were examined in macrophages, and levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 were examined in FLS. RESULTS sSiglec-9 significantly suppressed the clinical and histological incidence and severity of arthritis. The proportion of Foxp3-positive Treg cells significantly improved and serum TNF-$\alpha$ concentration decreased in vivo. Although sSiglec-9 reduced the expression of M1 markers in macrophages, it did not affect the expression of M2 markers and MMPs in FLS. Nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65 phosphorylation was attenuated by sSiglec-9, and chemical blockade of the NF-kB pathway reduced M1 marker expression in RAW264.7 cells. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of sSiglec-9 in a murine CIA model. The mechanism underlying these effects involves the suppression of M1 proinflammatory macrophages by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway. sSiglec-9 may provide a novel therapeutic option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to currently available drugs.},

abstract = {The Siglecs are a subfamily of I-type lectins (immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that bind sugars) that specifically recognize sialic acids. We report the cloning and characterization of human Siglec-9. The cDNA encodes a type 1 transmembrane protein with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytosolic tail containing two tyrosines, one within a typical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The N-terminal V-set Ig domain has most amino acid residues typical of Siglecs. Siglec-9 is expressed on granulocytes and monocytes. Expression of the full-length cDNA in COS cells induces sialic-acid dependent erythrocyte binding. A recombinant soluble form of the extracellular domain binds to alpha2-3 and alpha2-6-linked sialic acids. Typical of Siglecs, the carboxyl group and side chain of sialic acid are essential for recognition, and mutation of a critical arginine residue in domain 1 abrogates binding. The underlying glycan structure also affects binding, with Galbeta1-4Glc[NAc] being preferred. Siglec-9 shows closest homology to Siglec-7 and both belong to a Siglec-3/CD33-related subset of Siglecs (with Siglecs-5, -6, and -8). The Siglec-9 gene is on chromosome 19q13.3-13.4, in a cluster with all Siglec-3/CD33-related Siglec genes, suggesting their origin by gene duplications. A homology search of the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes suggests that Siglec expression may be limited to animals of deuterostome lineage, coincident with the appearance of the genes of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway.},

We refined the peak of association to a single gene for 19 loci, identified secondary independent effects at 6 loci and identified association to low-frequency variants at 4 loci. Bioinformatic analyses generated strong hypotheses for the causal SNP at seven loci.

While targeted disruption of the protein kinase C-beta (PKCbeta) gene in mice results in an immunodeficiency similar to xid, the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is significantly enhanced in PKCbeta-deficient B cells. We provide direct evidence that PKCbeta acts as a feedback loop inhibitor of Btk activation. Inhibition of PKCbeta results in a dramatic increase in B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated Ca2+ signaling. We identified a highly conserved PKCbeta serine phosphorylation site in a short linker within the Tec homology domain of Btk. Mutation of this phosphorylation site led to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane association of Btk, and augmented BCR and FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling in B and mast cells, respectively. These findings provide a novel mechanism whereby reversible translocation of Btk/Tec kinases regulates the threshold for immunoreceptor signaling and thereby modulates lymphocyte activation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Growth factors activate an array of cell survival signaling pathways. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases transduce signals emanating from their upstream activators MAP kinase kinases (MEKs). The MEK-MAP kinase signaling cassette is a key regulatory pathway promoting cell survival. The downstream effectors of the mammalian MEK-MAP kinase cell survival signal have not been previously described. RESULTS We identify here a pro-survival role for the serine/threonine kinase Rsk1, a downstream target of the MEK-MAP kinase signaling pathway. In cells that are dependent on interleukin-3 (IL-3) for survival, pharmacological inhibition of MEKs antagonized the IL-3 survival signal. In the absence of IL-3, a kinase-dead Rsk1 mutant eliminated the survival effect afforded by activated MEK. Conversely, a novel constitutively active Rsk1 allele restored the MEK-MAP kinase survival signal. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that Rsk1 directly phosphorylated the pro-apoptotic protein Bad at the serine residues that, when phosphorylated, abrogate Bad's pro-apoptotic function. Constitutively active Rsk1 caused constitutive Bad phosphorylation and protection from Bad-modulated cell death. Kinase-inactive Rsk1 mutants antagonize Bad phosphorylation. Bad mutations that prevented phosphorylation by Rsk1 also inhibited Rsk1-mediated cell survival. CONCLUSIONS These data support a model in which Rsk1 transduces the mammalian MEK-MAP kinase signal in part by phosphorylating Bad.},

abstract = {RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration and the overgrowth of synovial fibroblast. This invasive growth of synovial tissues corresponds with the progressive destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Several immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A and mizoribine, have been clinically used to control disease progression, though relatively little is known of their effects on rheumatoid synovium. Rapamycin exhibits a strong immunosuppressive activity by acting on T cell signalling pathways. In the present study we examined the effects of rapamycin on the growth of synovial fibroblast isolated from RA patients. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent growth factor in synovial fibroblasts isolated from RA patients. PDGF and serum stimulation resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), 70-kD-S6 kinase (P70S6k) and 90-kD-S6 kinase (P90rsk). Rapamycin, a macrolide immunosuppressant, inhibited completely growth factor-induced synovial fibroblast proliferation and P70S6k activation. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases and P90rsk were not influenced by rapamycin treatment. Our data demonstrate that growth factor-mediated P70S6k activation is closely related to the growth of synovial fibroblast, and suggest the efficacy of rapamycin for controlling synovial hyperplasia in RA.},

abstract = {We have identified and characterized a novel src homology 2 (SH2) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing adaptor protein, designated Bam32 (for B cell adaptor molecule of 32 kD). cDNAs encoding the human and mouse Bam32 coding sequences were isolated and the human bam32 gene was mapped to chromosome 4q25-q27. Bam32 is expressed by B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes or nonhematopoietic cells. Human germinal center B cells show increased Bam32 expression, and resting B cells rapidly upregulate expression of Bam32 after ligation of CD40, but not immunoglobulin M. Bam32 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor (BCR) ligation or pervanadate stimulation and associates with phospholipase Cgamma2. After BCR ligation, Bam32 is recruited to the plasma membrane through its PH domain. Membrane recruitment requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and an intact PI(3,4, 5)P(3)-binding motif, suggesting that membrane association occurs through binding to 3-phosphoinositides. Expression of Bam32 in B cells leads to a dose-dependent inhibition of BCR-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), which is blocked by deletion of the PH domain or mutation of the PI(3,4,5)P(3)-binding motif. Thus, Bam32 represents a novel B cell-associated adaptor that regulates BCR signaling downstream of PI3K.},

abstract = {In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the functional status of T cells is incompletely understood. Synovial T cells display phenotypic evidence of former activation, but there is poor production of T cell-derived cytokines in the synovium. In addition, synovial T cell proliferation upon mitogenic and antigenic stimulation was decreased compared with that in peripheral blood T cells. Moreover, previous reports revealed that early Ca2+ rises induced by TCR/CD3 stimulation were decreased in RA T cells compared with those in healthy controls. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of RA synovial T cell hyporesponsiveness, we analyzed the TCR/CD3-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in RA peripheral blood and synovial fluid (SF) T cells. SF T cells exhibited a decreased overall tyrosine phosphorylation pattern upon stimulation. Most notably, the induction of phosphorylation of p38 was virtually absent. Moreover, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR zeta-chain, one of the most proximal events in TCR signaling, is clearly diminished in RA SF T cells. The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in detectable levels of zeta-protein within synovial T cells. These results suggest that a defective TCR signaling underlies the hyporesponsiveness of synovial T cells in RA.},

abstract = {Tissues are a complex milieu consisting of numerous cell types. For example, understanding the cellular heterogeneity the tumor microenvironment is an emerging field of research. Numerous methods have been published in recent years for the enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles. However, the available methods suffer from three major problems: inferring cell subset based on gene sets learned and verified from limited sources; displaying only partial portrayal of the full cellular heterogeneity; and insufficient validation in mixed tissues. To address these issues we developed xCell, a novel gene-signature based method for inferring 64 immune and stroma cell types. We first curated and harmonized 1,822 transcriptomic profiles of pure human cell types from various sources, employed a curve fitting approach for linear comparison of cell types, and introduced a novel spillover compensation technique for separating between closely related cell types. We test the ability of our model learned from pure cell types to infer enrichments of cell types in mixed tissues, using both comprehensive in silico analyses, and by comparison to cytometry immunophenotyping to show that our scores outperform previously published methods. Finally, we explore the cell type enrichments in tumor samples and show that the cellular heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment uniquely characterizes different cancer types. We provide our method for inferring cell type abundances as a public resource to allow researchers to portray the cellular heterogeneity landscape of tissue expression profiles: http://xCell.ucsf.edu/.},

abstract = {Asthma is characterised by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Our objective was to determine molecular phenotypes of asthma by analysing sputum cell transcriptomics from 104 moderate-to-severe asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects.After filtering on the differentially expressed genes between eosinophil- and noneosinophil-associated sputum inflammation, we used unbiased hierarchical clustering on 508 differentially expressed genes and gene set variation analysis of specific gene sets.We defined three transcriptome-associated clusters (TACs): TAC1 (characterised by immune receptors IL33R, CCR3 and TSLPR), TAC2 (characterised by interferon-, tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$- and inflammasome-associated genes) and TAC3 (characterised by genes of metabolic pathways, ubiquitination and mitochondrial function). TAC1 showed the highest enrichment of gene signatures for interleukin-13/T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) and innate lymphoid cell type 2. TAC1 had the highest sputum eosinophilia and exhaled nitric oxide fraction, and was restricted to severe asthma with oral corticosteroid dependency, frequent exacerbations and severe airflow obstruction. TAC2 showed the highest sputum neutrophilia, serum C-reactive protein levels and prevalence of eczema. TAC3 had normal to moderately high sputum eosinophils and better preserved forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Gene-protein coexpression networks from TAC1 and TAC2 extended this molecular classification.We defined one Th2-high eosinophilic phenotype TAC1, and two non-Th2 phenotypes TAC2 and TAC3, characterised by inflammasome-associated and metabolic/mitochondrial pathways, respectively.},

abstract = {To improve our knowledge on the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated gene expression patterns in synovial tissue from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. DNA oligonucleotide microarray analysis was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in synovial tissue from pathologically classified tissue samples from RA (n = 20) and OA patients (n = 10). From 7131 gene sets displayed on the microarray chip, 101 genes were found to be upregulated and 300 genes to be downregulated in RA as compared with OA. Semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to validate microarray expression levels. These experiments revealed that Cys–X–Cys receptor (CXCR)1, CXCR2 and CXCR3 mRNAs, as well as Cys–X–Cys ligand (CXCL)9 (monokine induced by IFN-$\gamma$) and CXCL10 (IFN-$\gamma$ inducible protein 10) mRNAs, were significantly upregulated in RA as compared with OA disease. Elevated protein levels in RA synovial tissue were detected for CXCR1 and CXCR3 by Western blotting. Using immunohistochemistry, CXCR3 protein was found to be preferentially expressed on mast cells within synovial tissue from RA patients. These findings suggest that substantial expression of CXCR3 protein on mast cells within synovial tissue from RA patients plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of RA, accompanied by elevated levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. Mature mast cells are likely to contribute to and sustain the inflamed state in arthritic lesions (e.g. by production of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, proteinases, arachidonic acid metabolites and cytokines). Thus, the mast cell could become a potential target in therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95{\%} credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

abstract = {DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

The vast majority of interactions are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters in 17 human primary hematopoietic cell types. We show that promoter interactions are highly cell type specific and enriched for links between active promoters and epigenetically marked enhancers. Promoter interactomes reflect lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways. Our results demonstrate the power of primary cell promoter interactomes to reveal insights into genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying common diseases.},

abstract = {The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project is a large-scale coordinated effort to build a comprehensive systems biology reference resource. The goals of the program include the generation of a very large multidimensional data matrix and informatics and computational tools to integrate, analyze, and make the data readily accessible. LINCS data include genome-wide transcriptional signatures, biochemical protein binding profiles, cellular phenotypic response profiles and various other datasets for a wide range of cell model systems and molecular and genetic perturbations. Here we present a partial survey of this data facilitated by data standards and in particular a robust compound standardization workflow; we integrated several types of LINCS signatures and analyzed the results with a focus on mechanism of action (MoA) and chemical compounds. We illustrate how kinase targets can be related to disease models and relevant drugs. We identified some fundamental trends that appear to link Kinome binding profiles and transcriptional signatures to chemical information and biochemical binding profiles to transcriptional responses independent of chemical similarity. To fill gaps in the datasets we developed and applied predictive models. The results can be interpreted at the systems level as demonstrated based on a large number of signaling pathways. We can identify clear global relationships, suggesting robustness of cellular responses to chemical perturbation. Overall, the results suggest that chemical similarity is a useful measure at the systems level, which would support phenotypic drug optimization efforts. With this study we demonstrate the potential of such integrated analysis approaches and suggest prioritizing further experiments to fill the gaps in the current data.},

abstract = {Summary We developed the STOPGAP (Systematic Target OPportunity assessment by Genetic Association Predictions) database, an extensive catalog of human genetic associations mapped to effector gene candidates. STOPGAP draws on a variety of publicly available GWAS associations, linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures, functional genomic and variant annotation sources. Algorithms were developed to merge the association data, partition associations into non-overlapping LD clusters, map variants to genes and produce a variant-to-gene score used to rank the relative confidence among potential effector genes. This database can be used for a multitude of investigations into the genes and genetic mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation in human traits, as well as supporting drug discovery applications. Availability and implementation Shell, R, Perl and Python scripts and STOPGAP R data files (version 2.5.1 at publication) are available at https://github.com/StatGenPRD/STOPGAP .

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Connectivity map data and associated methodologies have become a valuable tool in understanding drug mechanism of action (MOA) and discovering new indications for drugs. One of the key ideas of connectivity map (CMAP) is to measure the connectivity between disease gene expression signatures and compound-induced gene expression profiles. Despite multiple impressive anecdotal validations, only a few systematic evaluations have assessed the accuracy of this aspect of CMAP, and most of these utilize drug-to-drug matching to transfer indications across the two drugs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:To assess CMAP methodologies in a more direct setting, namely the power of classifying known drug-disease relationships, we evaluated three CMAP-based methods on their prediction performance against a curated dataset of 890 true drug-indication pairs. The disease signatures were generated using Gene Logic BioExpress™ system and the compound profiles were derived from the Connectivity Map database (CMAP, build 02, http://www.broadinstitute.org/CMAP/).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:The similarity scoring algorithm called eXtreme Sum (XSum) performs better than the standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic in terms of the area under curve and can achieve a four-fold enrichment at 0.01 false positive rate level, with AUC = 2.2E-4, P value = 0.0035.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:Connectivity map can significantly enrich true positive drug-indication pairs given an effective matching algorithm.},

abstract = {Lysine acetylation is a key mechanism that regulates chromatin structure; aberrant acetylation levels have been linked to the development of several diseases. Acetyl-lysine modifications create docking sites for bromodomains, which are small interaction modules found on diverse proteins, some of which have a key role in the acetylation-dependent assembly of transcriptional regulator complexes. These complexes can then initiate transcriptional programmes that result in phenotypic changes. The recent discovery of potent and highly specific inhibitors for the BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family of bromodomains has stimulated intensive research activity in diverse therapeutic areas, particularly in oncology, where BET proteins regulate the expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, targeting BET bromodomains could hold potential for the treatment of inflammation and viral infection. Here, we highlight recent progress in the development of bromodomain inhibitors, and their potential applications in drug discovery.},

abstract = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly 'housekeeping', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

abstract = {Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in regulating gene expression and therefore a broad range of biological processes and diseases. DNA methylation is tissue-specific, dynamic, sequence-context-dependent and trans-generationally heritable, and these complex patterns of methylation highlight the significance of profiling DNA methylation to answer biological questions. In this review, we surveyed major methylation assays, along with comparisons and biological examples, to provide an overview of DNA methylation profiling techniques. The advances in microarray and sequencing technologies make genome-wide profiling possible at a single-nucleotide or even a single-cell resolution. These profiling approaches vary in many aspects, such as DNA input, resolution, genomic region coverage, and bioinformatics analysis, and selecting a feasible method requires knowledge of these methods. We first introduce the biological background of DNA methylation and its pattern in plants, animals and fungi. We present an overview of major experimental approaches to profiling genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and then extend to the single-cell methylome. To evaluate these methods, we outline their strengths and weaknesses and perform comparisons across the different platforms. Due to the increasing need to compute high-throughput epigenomic data, we interrogate the computational pipeline for bisulfite sequencing data and also discuss the concept of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This review summarizes the experimental and computational concepts for profiling genome-wide DNA methylation, followed by biological examples. Overall, this review provides researchers useful guidance for the selection of a profiling method suited to specific research questions.},

@article{Jiang2014,
abstract = {Adapter trimming is a prerequisite step for analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data when the reads are longer than the target DNA/RNA fragments. Although typically used in small RNA sequencing, adapter trimming is also used widely in other applications, such as genome DNA sequencing and transcriptome RNA/cDNA sequencing, where fragments shorter than a read are sometimes obtained because of the limitations of NGS protocols. For the newly emerged Nextera long mate-pair (LMP) protocol, junction adapters are located in the middle of all properly constructed fragments; hence, adapter trimming is essential to gain the correct paired reads. However, our investigations have shown that few adapter trimming tools meet both efficiency and accuracy requirements simultaneously. The performances of these tools can be even worse for paired-end and/or mate-pair sequencing. To improve the efficiency of adapter trimming, we devised a novel algorithm, the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm, which has O(k n) expected time with O(m) space, where k is the maximum number of differences allowed, n is the read length, and m is the adapter length. This algorithm makes it possible to fully enumerate all candidates that meet a specified threshold, e.g. error ratio, within a short period of time. To improve the accuracy of this algorithm, we designed a simple and easy-to-explain statistical scoring scheme to evaluate candidates in the pattern matching step. We also devised scoring schemes to fully exploit the paired-end/mate-pair information when it is applicable. All these features have been implemented in an industry-standard tool named Skewer (
                    https://sourceforge.net/projects/skewer
                    
                  ). Experiments on simulated data, real data of small RNA sequencing, paired-end RNA sequencing, and Nextera LMP sequencing showed that Skewer outperforms all other similar tools that have the same utility. Further, Skewer is considerably faster than other tools that have comparative accuracies; namely, one times faster for single-end sequencing, more than 12 times faster for paired-end sequencing, and 49{\%} faster for LMP sequencing. Skewer achieved as yet unmatched accuracies for adapter trimming with low time bound.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Asthma is a heterogeneous disease driven by diverse immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms. OBJECTIVES Using transcriptomic profiling of airway tissues, we sought to define the molecular phenotypes of severe asthma. METHODS The transcriptome derived from bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings of 107 subjects with moderate to severe asthma were annotated by gene set variation analysis using 42 gene signatures relevant to asthma, inflammation, and immune function. Topological data analysis of clinical and histologic data was performed to derive clusters, and the nearest shrunken centroid algorithm was used for signature refinement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Nine gene set variation analysis signatures expressed in bronchial biopsies and airway epithelial brushings distinguished two distinct asthma subtypes associated with high expression of T-helper cell type 2 cytokines and lack of corticosteroid response (group 1 and group 3). Group 1 had the highest submucosal eosinophils, as well as high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, exacerbation rates, and oral corticosteroid use, whereas group 3 patients showed the highest levels of sputum eosinophils and had a high body mass index. In contrast, group 2 and group 4 patients had an 86{\%} and 64{\%} probability, respectively, of having noneosinophilic inflammation. Using machine learning tools, we describe an inference scheme using the currently available inflammatory biomarkers sputum eosinophilia and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, along with oral corticosteroid use, that could predict the subtypes of gene expression within bronchial biopsies and epithelial cells with good sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of a transcriptomics-driven approach to phenotyping that segments patients who may benefit the most from specific agents that target T-helper cell type 2-mediated inflammation and/or corticosteroid insensitivity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Asthma is a heterogeneous disease in which there is a differential response to asthma treatments. This heterogeneity needs to be evaluated so that a personalized management approach can be provided. OBJECTIVES We stratified patients with moderate-to-severe asthma based on clinicophysiologic parameters and performed an omics analysis of sputum. METHODS Partition-around-medoids clustering was applied to a training set of 266 asthmatic participants from the European Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Diseases Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) adult cohort using 8 prespecified clinic-physiologic variables. This was repeated in a separate validation set of 152 asthmatic patients. The clusters were compared based on sputum proteomics and transcriptomics data. RESULTS Four reproducible and stable clusters of asthmatic patients were identified. The training set cluster T1 consists of patients with well-controlled moderate-to-severe asthma, whereas cluster T2 is a group of patients with late-onset severe asthma with a history of smoking and chronic airflow obstruction. Cluster T3 is similar to cluster T2 in terms of chronic airflow obstruction but is composed of nonsmokers. Cluster T4 is predominantly composed of obese female patients with uncontrolled severe asthma with increased exacerbations but with normal lung function. The validation set exhibited similar clusters, demonstrating reproducibility of the classification. There were significant differences in sputum proteomics and transcriptomics between the clusters. The severe asthma clusters (T2, T3, and T4) had higher sputum eosinophilia than cluster T1, with no differences in sputum neutrophil counts and exhaled nitric oxide and serum IgE levels. CONCLUSION Clustering based on clinicophysiologic parameters yielded 4 stable and reproducible clusters that associate with different pathobiological pathways.},

Impaired quality of life was associated with poor control and airway obstruction. Otherwise, the severe and mild/moderate cohorts were clinically very similar.

The aspiration is that these approaches will improve diagnosis, i.e. define pathological phenotypes, and facilitate the monitoring of disease and therapy, and also, unravel underlying molecular pathways. Biomarker studies can either select predefined biomarker(s) measured by specific methods or apply an "unbiased" approach involving detection platforms that are indiscriminate in focus.

abstract = {We consider the problem of identifying a subgroup of patients who may have an enhanced treatment effect in a randomized clinical trial, and it is desirable that the subgroup be defined by a limited number of covariates. For this problem, the development of a standard, pre-determined strategy may help to avoid the well-known dangers of subgroup analysis. We present a method developed to find subgroups of enhanced treatment effect. This method, referred to as 'Virtual Twins', involves predicting response probabilities for treatment and control 'twins' for each subject. The difference in these probabilities is then used as the outcome in a classification or regression tree, which can potentially include any set of the covariates. We define a measure Q({\^{A}}) to be the difference between the treatment effect in estimated subgroup {\^{A}} and the marginal treatment effect. We present several methods developed to obtain an estimate of Q({\^{A}}), including estimation of Q({\^{A}}) using estimated probabilities in the original data, using estimated probabilities in newly simulated data, two cross-validation-based approaches, and a bootstrap-based bias-corrected approach. Results of a simulation study indicate that the Virtual Twins method noticeably outperforms logistic regression with forward selection when a true subgroup of enhanced treatment effect exists. Generally, large sample sizes or strong enhanced treatment effects are needed for subgroup estimation. As an illustration, we apply the proposed methods to data from a randomized clinical trial.},

abstract = {A lack of understanding of human biology creates a hurdle for the development of precision medicines. To overcome this hurdle we need to better understand the potential synergy between a given investigational treatment (vs. placebo or active control) and various demographic or genetic factors, disease history and severity, etc., with the goal of identifying those patients at increased risk of exhibiting clinically meaningful treatment benefit. For this reason, we propose the VG method, which combines the idea of an individual treatment effect (ITE) from Virtual Twins (Foster, et al., 2011) with the unbiased variable selection and cutoff value determination algorithm from GUIDE (Loh, et al., 2015). Simulation results show the VG method has less variable selection bias than Virtual Twins and higher statistical power than GUIDE Interaction in the presence of prognostic variables with strong treatment effects. Type I error and predictive performance of Virtual Twins, GUIDE and VG are compared through the use of simulation studies. Results obtained after retrospectively applying VG to data from a clinical trial also are discussed.},

Here, I describe spatial analysis of functional enrichment (SAFE), a systematic method for annotating biological networks and examining their functional organization. SAFE visualizes the network in 2D space and measures the continuous distribution of functional enrichment across local neighborhoods, producing a list of the associated functions and a map of their relative positioning. I applied SAFE to annotate the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic interaction similarity network and protein-protein interaction network with gene ontology terms. SAFE annotations of the genetic network matched manually derived annotations, while taking less than 1{\%} of the time, and proved robust to noise and sensitive to biological signal. Integration of genetic interaction and chemical genomics data using SAFE revealed a link between vesicle-mediate transport and resistance to the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. These results demonstrate the utility of SAFE for examining biological networks and understanding their functional organization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND De novo inference of clinically relevant gene function relationships from tumor RNA-seq remains a challenging task. Current methods typically either partition patient samples into a few subtypes or rely upon analysis of pairwise gene correlations that will miss some groups in noisy data. Leveraging higher dimensional information can be expected to increase the power to discern targetable pathways, but this is commonly thought to be an intractable computational problem. METHODS In this work we adapt a recently developed machine learning algorithm for sensitive detection of complex gene relationships. The algorithm, CorEx, efficiently optimizes over multivariate mutual information and can be iteratively applied to generate a hierarchy of relatively independent latent factors. The learned latent factors are used to stratify patients for survival analysis with respect to both single factors and combinations. These analyses are performed and interpreted in the context of biological function annotations and protein network interactions that might be utilized to match patients to multiple therapies. RESULTS Analysis of ovarian tumor RNA-seq samples demonstrates the algorithm's power to infer well over one hundred biologically interpretable gene cohorts, several times more than standard methods such as hierarchical clustering and k-means. The CorEx factor hierarchy is also informative, with related but distinct gene clusters grouped by upper nodes. Some latent factors correlate with patient survival, including one for a pathway connected with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer that is regulated by a microRNA that modulates epigenetics. Further, combinations of factors lead to a synergistic survival advantage in some cases. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to studies that attempt to partition patients into a small number of subtypes (typically 4 or fewer) for treatment purposes, our approach utilizes subgroup information for combinatoric transcriptional phenotyping. Considering only the 66 gene expression groups that are found to both have significant Gene Ontology enrichment and are small enough to indicate specific drug targets implies a computational phenotype for ovarian cancer that allows for 3(66) possible patient profiles, enabling truly personalized treatment. The findings here demonstrate a new technique that sheds light on the complexity of gene expression dependencies in tumors and could eventually enable the use of patient RNA-seq profiles for selection of personalized and effective cancer treatments.},

abstract = {Repurposing FDA-approved drugs with the aid of gene signatures of disease can accelerate the development of new therapeutics. A major challenge to developing reliable drug predictions is heterogeneity. Different gene signatures of the same disease or drug treatment often show poor overlap across studies, as a consequence of both biological and technical variability, and this can affect the quality and reproducibility of computational drug predictions. Existing algorithms for signature-based drug repurposing use only individual signatures as input. But for many diseases, there are dozens of signatures in the public domain. Methods that exploit all available transcriptional knowledge on a disease should produce improved drug predictions. Here, we adapt an established meta-analysis framework to address the problem of drug repurposing using an ensemble of disease signatures. Our computational pipeline takes as input a collection of disease signatures, and outputs a list of drugs predicted to consistently reverse pathological gene changes. We apply our method to conduct the largest and most systematic repurposing study on lung cancer transcriptomes, using 21 signatures. We show that scaling up transcriptional knowledge significantly increases the reproducibility of top drug hits, from 44{\%} to 78{\%}. We extensively characterize drug hits in silico, demonstrating that they slow growth significantly in nine lung cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 collection, and identify CALM1 and PLA2G4A as promising drug targets for lung cancer. Our meta-analysis pipeline is general, and applicable to any disease context; it can be applied to improve the results of signature-based drug repurposing by leveraging the large number of disease signatures in the public domain.},

Here, we applied a computational approach to discover new drug therapies for IBD in silico, using publicly available molecular data reporting gene expression in IBD samples and 164 small-molecule drug compounds. Among the top compounds predicted to be therapeutic for IBD by our approach were prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to treat IBD, and topiramate, an anticonvulsant drug not previously described to have efficacy for IBD or any related disorders of inflammation or the gastrointestinal tract. Using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced rodent model of IBD, we experimentally validated our topiramate prediction in vivo. Oral administration of topiramate significantly reduced gross pathological signs and microscopic damage in primary affected colon tissue in the TNBS-induced rodent model of IBD. These findings suggest that topiramate might serve as a therapeutic option for IBD in humans and support the use of public molecular data and computational approaches to discover new therapeutic options for disease.},

Although the results have provided valuable biological insights for many common diseases, the translation of the genetics findings from GWAS into the clinic remains limited and a topic of intense debate. Among the factors that could explain this situation are that the road from a gene target to an approved marketed drug takes in general more than ten years and most GWAS results have only been obtained over the past four years. Furthermore, because the effect size of the common variants identified by GWAS, alone or in aggregation, is generally modest, the impact in terms of personalized, individually tailored medicine has been negligible. We present here an analysis of another potential application of GWAS data— drug repositioning. In the following study, we assess the utility of GWAS in systematically and rapidly identifying alternative or refined indications for existing drugs.},

abstract = {Target identification and validation is a pressing challenge in the pharmaceutical industry, with many of the programmes that fail for efficacy reasons showing poor association between the drug target and the disease. Computational prediction of successful targets could have a considerable impact on attrition rates in the drug discovery pipeline by significantly reducing the initial search space. Here, we explore whether gene–disease association data from the Open Targets platform is sufficient to predict therapeutic targets that are actively being pursued by pharmaceutical companies or are already on the market. To test our hypothesis, we train four different classifiers (a random forest, a support vector machine, a neural network and a gradient boosting machine) on partially labelled data and evaluate their performance using nested cross-validation and testing on an independent set. We then select the best performing model and use it to make predictions on more than 15,000 genes. Finally, we validate our predictions by mining the scientific literature for proposed therapeutic targets. We observe that the data types with the best predictive power are animal models showing a disease-relevant phenotype, differential expression in diseased tissue and genetic association with the disease under investigation. On a test set, the neural network classifier achieves over 71{\%} accuracy with an AUC of 0.76 when predicting therapeutic targets in a semi-supervised learning setting. We use this model to gain insights into current and failed programmes and to predict 1431 novel targets, of which a highly significant proportion has been independently proposed in the literature. Our in silico approach shows that data linking genes and diseases is sufficient to predict novel therapeutic targets effectively and confirms that this type of evidence is essential for formulating or strengthening hypotheses in the target discovery process. Ultimately, more rapid and automated target prioritisation holds the potential to reduce both the costs and the development times associated with bringing new medicines to patients.},

abstract = {The underlying molecular mechanisms for many autoimmune diseases are poorly understood. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an exceptionally well-suited model for studying autoimmune diseases due to its early onset and the possibility to analyze cells derived from the site of inflammation. Epigenetic profiling, utilizing primary JIA patient-derived cells, can contribute to the understanding of autoimmune diseases. With H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a disease-specific, inflammation-associated, typical enhancer and super-enhancer signature in JIA patient synovial-fluid-derived CD4(+) memory/effector T cells. RNA sequencing of autoinflammatory site-derived patient T cells revealed that BET inhibition, utilizing JQ1, inhibited immune-related super-enhancers and preferentially reduced disease-associated gene expression, including cytokine-related processes. Altogether, these results demonstrate the potential use of enhancer profiling to identify disease mediators and provide evidence for BET inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Key Points • MCL cells are mobilized into the peripheral blood of patients treated with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. • Ibrutinib dose-dependently inhibits BCR-and chemokine-mediated adhesion and migration of MCL cells. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is a highly potent oral Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor in clinical development for treating B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often show marked, transient increases of circulating CLL cells following ibrutinib treatments, as seen with other inhibitors of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway. In a phase 1 study of ibrutinib, we noted similar effects in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we characterize the patterns and phenotypes of cells mobilized among patients with MCL and further investigate the mechanism of this effect. Peripheral blood CD19 1 CD5 1 cells from MCL patients were found to have significant reduction in the expression of CXCR4, CD38, and Ki67 after 7 days of treatment. In addition, plasma chemokines such as CCL22, CCL4, and CXCL13 were reduced 40{\%} to 60{\%} after treatment. Mechanistically, ibrutinib inhibited BCR-and chemokine-mediated adhesion and chemo-taxis of MCL cell lines and dose-dependently inhibited BCR, stromal cell, and CXCL12/ CXCL13 stimulations of pBTK, pPLCg2, pERK, or pAKT. Importantly, ibrutinib inhibited migration of MCL cells beneath stromal cells in coculture. We propose that BTK is essential for the homing of MCL cells into lymphoid tissues, and its inhibition results in an egress of malignant cells into peripheral blood. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as {\#}NCT00114738.},

To identify the epigenetic changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members. The hypermethylation was accompanied with decreased levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis. In addition, we found hypermethylation of the TSHR gene first intron, where several GD-associated polymorphisms are located. Our results demonstrate an involvement of dysregulated DNA methylation and histone modifications at T cell signaling genes in GD patients.},

abstract = {Patient interactions with health care providers result in entries to electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.},

We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between two variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell???s chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

At the data level, DeepCare represents care episodes as vectors in space, models patient health state trajectories through explicit memory of historical records. Built on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), DeepCare introduces time parameterizations to handle irregular timed events by moderating the forgetting and consolidation of memory cells. DeepCare also incorporates medical interventions that change the course of illness and shape future medical risk. Moving up to the health state level, historical and present health states are then aggregated through multiscale temporal pooling, before passing through a neural network that estimates future outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of DeepCare for disease progression modeling, intervention recommendation, and future risk prediction. On two important cohorts with heavy social and economic burden -- diabetes and mental health -- the results show improved modeling and risk prediction accuracy.},

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly anno-tated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technolo-gies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.},

'Experiments of nature' - naturally occurring mutations in humans that affect the activity of a particular protein target or targets - can be used to estimate the probable efficacy and toxicity of a drug targeting such proteins, as well as to establish causal rather than reactive relationships between targets and outcomes. Here, we describe the concept of dose-response curves derived from experiments of nature, with an emphasis on human genetics as a valuable tool to prioritize molecular targets in drug development. We discuss empirical examples of drug-gene pairs that support the role of human genetics in testing therapeutic hypotheses at the stage of target validation, provide objective criteria to prioritize genetic findings for future drug discovery efforts and highlight the limitations of a target validation approach that is anchored in human genetics.},

A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x 's and y 's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=g . Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of nx ′ s and my ′ s is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m . Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n=m=8 . At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x){\textgreater}g(x) for every x .},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {UniChem is a freely available compound identifier mapping service on the internet, designed to optimize the efficiency with which structure-based hyperlinks may be built and maintained between chemistry-based resources. In the past, the creation and maintenance of such links at EMBL-EBI, where several chemistry-based resources exist, has required independent efforts by each of the separate teams. These efforts were complicated by the different data models, release schedules, and differing business rules for compound normalization and identifier nomenclature that exist across the organization. UniChem, a large-scale, non-redundant database of Standard InChIs with pointers between these structures and chemical identifiers from all the separate chemistry resources, was developed as a means of efficiently sharing the maintenance overhead of creating these links. Thus, for each source represented in UniChem, all links to and from all other sources are automatically calculated and immediately available for all to use. Updated mappings are immediately available upon loading of new data releases from the sources. Web services in UniChem provide users with a single simple automatable mechanism for maintaining all links from their resource to all other sources represented in UniChem. In addition, functionality to track changes in identifier usage allows users to monitor which identifiers are current, and which are obsolete. Lastly, UniChem has been deliberately designed to allow additional resources to be included with minimal effort. Indeed, the recent inclusion of data sources external to EMBL-EBI has provided a simple means of providing users with an even wider selection of resources with which to link to, all at no extra cost, while at the same time providing a simple mechanism for external resources to link to all EMBL-EBI chemistry resources.},

abstract = {Genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian cells. At the same time, curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized data into ∼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities, as well as form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade, it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.},

abstract = {An increasing number of genes have been experimentally confirmed in recent years as causative genes to various human diseases. The newly available knowledge can be exploited by machine learning methods to discover additional unknown genes that are likely to be associated with diseases. In particular, positive unlabeled learning (PU learning) methods, which require only a positive training set P (confirmed disease genes) and an unlabeled set U (the unknown candidate genes) instead of a negative training set N, have been shown to be effective in uncovering new disease genes in the current scenario. Using only a single source of data for prediction can be susceptible to bias due to incompleteness and noise in the genomic data and a single machine learning predictor prone to bias caused by inherent limitations of individual methods. In this paper, we propose an effective PU learning framework that integrates multiple biological data sources and an ensemble of powerful machine learning classifiers for disease gene identification. Our proposed method integrates data from multiple biological sources for training PU learning classifiers. A novel ensemble-based PU learning method EPU is then used to integrate multiple PU learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust disease gene predictions. Our evaluation experiments across six disease groups showed that EPU achieved significantly better results compared with various state-of-the-art prediction methods as well as ensemble learning classifiers. Through integrating multiple biological data sources for training and the outputs of an ensemble of PU learning classifiers for prediction, we are able to minimize the potential bias and errors in individual data sources and machine learning algorithms to achieve more accurate and robust disease gene predictions. In the future, our EPU method provides an effective framework to integrate the additional biological and computational resources for better disease gene predictions.},

abstract = {Abstract High-dimensional problem domains pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. The presence of irrelevant features can conceal the presence of anomalies. This problem, known as the ‘curse of dimensionality', is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient. The experimental results show that our proposed model yields comparable anomaly detection performance with a deep autoencoder, while reducing its training and testing time by a factor of 3 and 1000, respectively.},

While this data may be useful for biomarker identification and drug discovery, the bulk of it remains underutilized. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are efficient algorithms based on the use of compositional layers of neurons, with advantages well matched to the challenges -omics data presents. While achieving state-of-the-art results and even surpassing human accuracy in many challenging tasks, the adoption of deep learning in biomedicine has been comparatively slow. Here, we discuss key features of deep learning that may give this approach an edge over other machine learning methods. We then consider limitations and review a number of applications of deep learning in biomedical studies demonstrating proof of concept and practical utility.},

At the same time, deep learning has advanced rapidly since early 2000s and is recently showing a state-of-the-art performance in various fields. So naturally, applying deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insights from data is under the spotlight of both the academia and the industry. This article reviews some research of deep learning in bioinformatics. To provide a big picture, we categorized the research by both bioinformatics domains (i.e., omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architectures (i.e., deep neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, modified neural network) as well as present brief descriptions of each work. Additionally, we introduce a few issues of deep learning in bioinformatics such as problems of class imbalance data and suggest future research directions such as multimodal deep learning. We believe that this paper could provide valuable insights and be a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning in their bioinformatics studies.},

abstract = {Secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to advance clinical research and better inform clinical decision making. Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.},

In this paper, EHR data is used to discover novel relationships between diseases by studying their comorbidities (co-occurrences in patients). A novel embedding model is designed to extract knowledge from disease comorbidities by learning from a large-scale EHR database comprising more than 35 million inpatient cases spanning nearly a decade, revealing significant improvements on disease phenotyping over current computational approaches. In addition, the use of the proposed methodology is extended to discover novel disease-gene associations by including valuable domain knowledge from genome-wide association studies. To evaluate our approach, its effectiveness is compared against a held-out set where, again, it revealed very compelling results. For selected diseases, we further identify candidate gene lists for which disease-gene associations were not studied previously. Thus, our approach provides biomedical researchers with new tools to filter genes of interest, thus, reducing costly lab studies.},

Computational repositioning is especially appealing because of the ability to rapidly screen candidates in silico and to reduce the number of possible repositioning candidates. What is unclear, however, is how useful such methods are in producing clinically efficacious repositioning hypotheses. Furthermore, there is no agreement in the field over the proper way to perform validation of in silico predictions, and in fact no systematic review of repositioning validation methodologies. To address this unmet need, we review the computational repositioning literature and capture studies in which authors claimed to have validated their work. Our analysis reveals widespread variation in the types of strategies, predictions made and databases used as 'gold standards'. We highlight a key weakness of the most commonly used strategy and propose a path forward for the consistent analytic validation of repositioning techniques.},

abstract = {The high incidence of complex diseases has become a worldwide threat to human health. Multiple targets and pathways are perturbed during the pathological process of complex diseases. Systematic investigation of complex relationship between drugs and diseases is necessary for new association discovery and drug repurposing. For this purpose, three causal networks were constructed herein for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms, respectively. A causal inference-probabilistic matrix factorization (CI-PMF) approach was proposed to predict and classify drug-disease associations, and further used for drug-repositioning predictions. First, multilevel systematic relations between drugs and diseases were integrated from heterogeneous databases to construct causal networks connecting drug-target-pathway-gene-disease. Then, the association scores between drugs and diseases were assessed by evaluating a drug's effects on multiple targets and pathways. Furthermore, PMF models were learned based on known interactions, and associations were then classified into three types by trained models. Finally, therapeutic associations were predicted based upon the ranking of association scores and predicted association types. In terms of drug-disease association prediction, modified causal inference included in CI-PMF outperformed existing causal inference with a higher AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) score and greater precision. Moreover, CI-PMF performed better than single modified causal inference in predicting therapeutic drug-disease associations. In the top 30{\%} of predicted associations, 58.6{\%} (136/232), 50.8{\%} (31/61), and 39.8{\%} (140/352) hit known therapeutic associations, while precisions obtained by the latter were only 10.2{\%} (231/2264), 8.8{\%} (36/411), and 9.7{\%} (189/1948). Clinical verifications were further conducted for the top 100 newly predicted therapeutic associations. As a result, 21, 12, and 32 associations have been studied and many treatment effects of drugs on diseases were investigated for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms, respectively. Related chains in causal networks were extracted for these 65 clinical-verified associations, and we further illustrated the therapeutic role of etodolac in breast cancer by inferred chains. Overall, CI-PMF is a useful approach for associating drugs with complex diseases and provides potential values for drug repositioning.},

abstract = {Predicting the response of a specific cancer to a therapy is a major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a personalised treatment. High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC₅₀ values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the considered drugs. Models predicted IC₅₀ values in a 8-fold cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R² of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R² of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC₅₀ values rather than experimentally measuring them. The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity.},

abstract = {Motivation: In silico prediction of drug-target interactions plays an important role toward identifying and developing new uses of existing or abandoned drugs. Network-based approaches have recently become a popular tool for discovering new drug-target interactions (DTIs). Unfortunately, most of these network-based approaches can only predict binary interactions between drugs and targets, and infor-mation about different types of interactions has not been well ex-ploited for DTI prediction in previous studies. On the other hand, incorporating additional information about drug-target relationships or drug modes of action can improve prediction of DTIs. Furthermore, the predicted types of DTIs can broaden our understand-ing about the molecular basis of drug action. Results: We propose a first machine learning approach to integrate multiple types of DTIs and predict unknown drug-target relationships or drug modes of action. We cast the new DTI prediction problem into a two-layer graphical model, called restricted Boltzmann machine, and apply a practical learning algorithm to train our model and make pre-dictions. Tests on two public databases show that our restricted Boltzmann machine model can effectively capture the latent features of a DTI network and achieve excellent performance on predicting different types of DTIs, with the area under precision-recall curve up to 89.6. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multiple types of DTIs can significantly outperform other predictions either by simply mixing multiple types of interactions without distinction or using only a single interaction type. Further tests show that our approach can infer a high fraction of novel DTIs that has been validated by known experiments in the literature or other databases. These results indicate that our approach can have highly practical relevance to DTI predic-tion and drug repositioning, and hence advance the drug discovery process. Availability: Software and datasets are available on request.},

abstract = {Target-based screening is one of the major approaches in drug discovery. Besides the intended target, unexpected drug off-target interactions often occur, and many of them have not been recognized and characterized. The off-target interactions can be responsible for either therapeutic or side effects. Thus, identifying the genome-wide off-targets of lead compounds or existing drugs will be critical for designing effective and safe drugs, and pro-viding new opportunities for drug repurposing. Although many computational methods have been developed to predict drug-target interactions, they are either less accurate than the one that we are proposing here or computationally too intensive, thereby limiting their capability for large-scale off-target identification. In addition, the performances of most machine learning based algorithms have been mainly evaluated to predict off-target inter-actions in the same gene family for hundreds of chemicals. It is not clear how these algo-rithms perform in terms of detecting off-targets across gene families on a proteome scale. Here, we are presenting a fast and accurate off-target prediction method, REMAP, which is based on a dual regularized one-class collaborative filtering algorithm, to explore continu-ous chemical space, protein space, and their interactome on a large scale. When tested in a reliable, extensive, and cross-gene family benchmark, REMAP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, REMAP is highly scalable. It can screen a dataset of 200 thousands chemicals against 20 thousands proteins within 2 hours. Using the recon-structed genome-wide target profile as the fingerprint of a chemical compound, we pre-dicted that seven FDA-approved drugs can be repurposed as novel anti-cancer therapies. The anti-cancer activity of six of them is supported by experimental evidences. Thus, REMAP is a valuable addition to the existing in silico toolbox for drug target identification,},

abstract = {: Existing computational methods for drug repositioning either rely only on the gene expression response of cell lines after treatment, or on drug-to-disease relationships, merging several information levels. However, the noisy nature of the gene expression and the scarcity of genomic data for many diseases are important limitations to such approaches. Here we focused on a drug-centered approach by predicting the therapeutic class of FDA-approved compounds, not considering data concerning the diseases. We propose a novel computational approach to predict drug repositioning based on state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. We have integrated multiple layers of information: i) on the distances of the drugs based on how similar are their chemical structures, ii) on how close are their targets within the protein-protein interaction network, and iii) on how correlated are the gene expression patterns after treatment. Our classifier reaches high accuracy levels (78{\%}), allowing us to re-interpret the top misclassifications as re-classifications, after rigorous statistical evaluation. Efficient drug repurposing has the potential to significantly impact the whole field of drug development. The results presented here can significantly accelerate the translation into the clinics of known compounds for novel therapeutic uses.},

In this paper we demonstrate how deep neural networks (DNN) trained on large transcriptional response data sets can classify various drugs to therapeutic categories solely based on their transcriptional profiles. We used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines from the LINCS Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH. To train the DNN, we utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled data set of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours.

abstract = {Identifying interactions between known drugs and targets is a major challenge in drug repositioning. In silico prediction of drug–target interaction (DTI) can speed up the expensive and time-consuming experimental work by providing the most potent DTIs. In silico prediction of DTI can also provide insights about the potential drug–drug interaction and promote the exploration of drug side effects. Traditionally, the performance of DTI prediction depends heavily on the descriptors used to represent the drugs and the target proteins. In this paper, to accurately predict new DTIs between approved drugs and targets without separating the targets into different classes, we developed a deep-learning-based algorithmic framework named DeepDTIs. It first abstracts representations from raw input descriptors using unsupervised pretraining and then applies known label pairs of interaction to build a classification model. Compared with other methods, it is found that DeepDTIs reaches or outperforms other state-of-the-a...},

The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias $\backslash$nand variance components.

We performed a genetic association study in 5,256 cases and 47,936 controls, with replication of select top results (P {\textless} 5 × 0 −6) in 9,498 cases and 9,748 controls. In the combined meta-analysis, we identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance, including 3 new associations with COPD. Nine of these 3 loci have been associated with lung function in general population samples 2–7 , while 4 (EEFSEC, DSP, MTCL1, and SFTPD) are new. We noted two loci shared with pulmonary fibrosis 8,9 (FAM13A and DSP) but that had opposite risk alleles for COPD. None of our loci overlapped with genome-wide associations for asthma, although one locus has been implicated in joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity 0 . We also identified genetic correlation between COPD and asthma. Our findings highlight new loci associated with COPD, demonstrate the importance of specific loci associated with lung function to COPD, and identify potential regions of genetic overlap between COPD and other respiratory diseases. COPD is characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limita-tion diagnosed by lung function testing 1 . Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor, but susceptibility is also influenced by genetics 11–13 . We established the International COPD Genetics Consortium (ICGC) to coordinate efforts to find susceptibility loci 14 . We defined cases on the basis of pre-bronchodilator evidence of moderate-to-severe airflow limitation by modified GOLD criteria 15 ; controls had normal spirometry measures, and all analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and cigarette smoking (pack-years and smoking status). We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Fig. 1). In stage 1, we combined 26 cohorts (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) compris-ing 63,192 individuals (15,256 COPD cases and 47,936 controls).

We identified 13 genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5 × 10 −8) associa-tions in stage 1. Following the stage 2 analysis, an additional nine loci achieved genome-wide significance in the overall meta-analysis (Fig. 2, Table 1, and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Analyses of only European-ancestry (Supplementary Table 4) and only African-ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5) stage 1 cohorts did not identify unique association signals.

abstract = {Genetic association studies have identified 25 risk loci for inflammatory bowel disease –8 , thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification and prioritization. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that includes two common disease subtypes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Disease pathogenesis is poorly understood but is likely driven by a dysregulated immune response to unknown environmental triggers in genetically susceptible indi-viduals. Treatment regimes often use potent immunomodulators to achieve and maintain remission of symptoms. However, patients commonly experience side effects, lose response to treatment or develop complications of IBD, with many ultimately requiring major abdominal surgery. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and targeted follow-up using the Immunochip have been very successful at identifying genetic risk loci for IBD, but the increased biological understanding has not yet had a substantial impact on therapy for these disorders. To further expand understanding of the biology of these disorders, we carried out a GWAS of 12,160 IBD cases and 13,145 population controls of European ancestry who had not been included in any genome-wide meta-analysis of IBD thus far (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 1). We imputed genotypes using a reference panel comprising whole-genome sequences from 4,686 IBD cases 9 and 6,285 publically available population controls 10,11 . Following quality control (Online Methods), we tested 9.7 million sites for asso-ciation. At the 232 IBD-associated SNPs in the latest meta-analysis by the International IBD Genetics Consortium 1 , 228 had effects in the same direction in our data, 188 showed at least nominal evidence of replication (P {\textless} 0.05) and none showed significant evidence of Genome-wide association study implicates immune activation of multiple integrin genes in inflammatory bowel disease},

abstract = {A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of {\textgreater}100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ∼10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.},

abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry remains under huge pressure to address the high attrition rates in drug development. Attempts to reduce the number of efficacy- and safety-related failures by analysing possible links to the physicochemical properties of small-molecule drug candidates have been inconclusive because of the limited size of data sets from individual companies. Here, we describe the compilation and analysis of combined data on the attrition of drug candidates from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The analysis reaffirms that control of physicochemical properties during compound optimization is beneficial in identifying compounds of candidate drug quality and indicates for the first time a link between the physicochemical properties of compounds and clinical failure due to safety issues. The results also suggest that further control of physicochemical properties is unlikely to have a significant effect on attrition rates and that additional work is required to address safety-related failures. Further cross-company collaborations will be crucial to future progress in this area.},

@article{Lee2011,
abstract = {Network "guilt by association" (GBA) is a proven approach for identifying novel disease genes based on the observation that similar mutational phenotypes arise from functionally related genes. In principle, this approach could account even for nonadditive genetic interactions, which underlie the synergistic combinations of mutations often linked to complex diseases. Here, we analyze a large-scale, human gene functional interaction network (dubbed HumanNet). We show that candidate disease genes can be effectively identified by GBA in cross-validated tests using label propagation algorithms related to Google's PageRank. However, GBA has been shown to work poorly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where many genes are somewhat implicated, but few are known with very high certainty. Here, we resolve this by explicitly modeling the uncertainty of the associations and incorporating the uncertainty for the seed set into the GBA framework. We observe a significant boost in the power to detect validated candidate genes for Crohn's disease and type 2 diabetes by comparing our predictions to results from follow-up meta-analyses, with incorporation of the network serving to highlight the JAK-STAT pathway and associated adaptors GRB2/SHC1 in Crohn's disease and BACH2 in type 2 diabetes. Consideration of the network during GWAS thus conveys some of the benefits of enrolling more participants in the GWAS study. More generally, we demonstrate that a functional network of human genes provides a valuable statistical framework for prioritizing candidate disease genes, both for candidate gene-based and GWAS-based studies.},

The most relevant tissues to study the functional consequences of asthma are the airways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We utilized publically available data to derive expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for human epithelial cells from small and large airways, and applied the eQTLs in the interpretation of GWAS results of asthma and related phenotypes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For the small airways (N=105), we discovered 660 eQTLs at a 10{\%} FDR (false discovery rate) among which 315 eQTLs were not previously reported in a large-scale eQTL study of whole lung tissue. A large fraction of the identified eQTLs is supported by data from ENCODE showing that the eQTLs reside in regulatory elements (57.5{\%} and 67.6{\%} of cis- and trans-eQTLs, respectively). Published pulmonary GWAS hits were enriched as airway epithelial eQTLs (9.2 fold). Further, genes regulated by asthma GWAS loci in epithelium are significantly enriched in immune response pathways, such as IL4 signaling (FDR=5.2x10-4).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The airway epithelial eQTLs described in this study are complementary to previously reported lung eQTLs and represent a powerful resource to link GWAS associated variants to their regulatory function and thus elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma and airway related conditions.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci reproducibly associated with pulmonary diseases; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these associations are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to discover genetic variants affecting gene expression in human lung tissue, to refine susceptibility loci for asthma identified in GWAS studies, and to use the genetics of gene expression and network analyses to find key molecular drivers of asthma. We performed a genome-wide search for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 1,111 human lung samples. The lung eQTL dataset was then used to inform asthma genetic studies reported in the literature. The top ranked lung eQTLs were integrated with the GWAS on asthma reported by the GABRIEL consortium to generate a Bayesian gene expression network for discovery of novel molecular pathways underpinning asthma. We detected 17,178 cis- and 593 trans- lung eQTLs, which can be used to explore the functional consequences of loci associated with lung diseases and traits. Some strong eQTLs are also asthma susceptibility loci. For example, rs3859192 on chr17q21 is robustly associated with the mRNA levels of GSDMA (P = 3.55 × 10(-151)). The genetic-gene expression network identified the SOCS3 pathway as one of the key drivers of asthma. The eQTLs and gene networks identified in this study are powerful tools for elucidating the causal mechanisms underlying pulmonary disease. This data resource offers much-needed support to pinpoint the causal genes and characterize the molecular function of gene variants associated with lung diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have underscored the role of enhancers in defining cell type-specific transcriptomes. Cell type-specific enhancers are bound by combinations of shared and cell type-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, little is known about combinatorial binding of TFs to enhancers, dynamics of TF binding following stimulation, or the downstream effects on gene expression. Here, we address these questions in two types of myeloid antigen presenting cells (APCs), macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), before and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent stimulator of the innate immune response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We classified enhancers according to the combination of TFs binding them. There were significant correlations between the sets of TFs bound to enhancers prior to stimulation and expression changes of nearby genes after stimulation. Importantly, a set of enhancers pre-bound by PU.1, C/EBP$\beta$, ATF3, IRF4, and JunB was strongly associated with induced genes and binding by stimulus-activated regulators. Our classification suggests that transient loss of ATF3 binding to a subset of these enhancers is important for regulation of early-induced genes. Changes in TF-enhancer binding after stimulation were correlated with binding by additional activated TFs and with the presence of proximally located enhancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this study reveal the complexity and dynamics of TF- enhancer binding before and after stimulation in myeloid APCs.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Yet, only a small fraction of potentially causal genes—about 65 genes out of an estimated several hundred—are known with strong genetic evidence from sequencing studies. We developed a complementary machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific gene network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism risk genes, including hundreds of candidates for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach was validated in a large independent case–control sequencing study. Leveraging these genome- wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrated that the large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key pathways and developmental stages of the brain. Finally, we identified likely pathogenic genes within frequent autism- associated copy-number variants and proposed genes and pathways that are likely mediators of ASD across multiple copy-number variants.

abstract = {Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model in which lineage-determining factors act in a collaborative manner to select and prime cell-specific enhancers, thereby enabling signal-dependent transcription factors to bind and function in a cell-type-specific manner. Consistent with this model, TLR4 signaling primarily regulates macrophage gene expression through a pre-existing enhancer landscape. However, TLR4 signaling also induces priming of {\~{}}3,000 enhancer-like regions de novo, enabling visualization of intermediates in enhancer selection and activation.Unexpectedly, we find that enhancer transcription precedes local mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2). H3K4 methylation at denovo enhancers is primarily dependent on the histone methyltransferases Mll1, Mll2/4, and Mll3 and is significantly reduced by inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation. Collectively, these findings suggest an essential role of enhancer transcription inH3K4me1/2 deposition at de novo enhancers that is independent of potential functions of the resulting eRNA transcripts. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {According to current models, once the cell has reached terminal differentiation, the enhancer repertoire is completely established and maintained by cooperatively acting lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs). TFs activated by extracellular stimuli operate within this predetermined repertoire, landing close to where master regulators are constitutively bound. Here, we describe latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are unbound by TFs and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers but acquire these features in response to stimulation. Macrophage stimulation caused sequential binding of stimulus-activated and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer marks. Once unveiled, many of these enhancers did not return to a latent state when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Disease correlations and temporal disease progression (trajectories) have mainly been analysed with focus on a small number of diseases or using large-scale approaches without time consideration, exceeding a few years. So far, no large-scale studies have focused on defining a comprehensive set of disease trajectories. Here we present a discovery-driven analysis of temporal disease progression patterns using data from an electronic health registry covering the whole population of Denmark. We use the entire spectrum of diseases and convert 14.9 years of registry data on 6.2 million patients into 1,171 significant trajectories. We group these into patterns centred on a small number of key diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and gout, which are central to disease progression and hence important to diagnose early to mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes. We suggest such trajectory analyses may be useful for predicting and preventing future diseases of individual patients},

Modulation of import is thought to control the plastid's proteome, developmental fate, and functions. Using forward genetics, we identified Arabidopsis SP1, which encodes a RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase of the chloroplast outer membrane. The SP1 protein associated with TOC complexes and mediated ubiquitination of TOC components, promoting their degradation. Mutant sp1 plants performed developmental transitions that involve plastid proteome changes inefficiently, indicating a requirement for reorganization of the TOC machinery. Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome system acts on plastids to control their development.},

abstract = {Most genomes, including yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are pervasively transcribed producing numerous non-coding RNAs, many of which are unstable and eliminated by nuclear or cytoplasmic surveillance pathways. We previously showed that accumulation of PHO84 antisense RNA (asRNA), in cells lacking the nuclear exosome component Rrp6, is paralleled by repression of sense transcription in a process dependent on the Hda1 histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the H3K4 histone methyl transferase Set1. Here we investigate this process genome-wide and measure the whole transcriptome of various histone modification mutants in a $\Delta$rrp6 strain using tiling arrays. We confirm widespread occurrence of potentially antisense-dependent gene regulation and identify three functionally distinct classes of genes that accumulate asRNAs in the absence of Rrp6. These classes differ in whether the genes are silenced by the asRNA and whether the silencing is HDACs and histone methyl transferase-dependent. Among the distinguishing features of asRNAs with regulatory potential, we identify weak early termination by Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1, extension of the asRNA into the open reading frame promoter and dependence of the silencing capacity on Set1 and the HDACs Hda1 and Rpd3 particularly at promoters undergoing extensive chromatin remodelling. Finally, depending on the efficiency of Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1 early termination, asRNA levels are modulated and their capability of silencing is changed.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes play an important role in gene regulation. Molecular studies observed that nucleosome binding in promoters tends to be repressive. In contrast, genomic studies have delivered conflicting results: An analysis of yeast grown on diverse carbon sources reported that nucleosome occupancies remain largely unchanged between conditions, whereas a study of the heat-shock response suggested that nucleosomes get evicted at promoters of genes with increased expression. Consequently, there are few general principles that capture the relationship between chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. Here, we present a qualitative model for nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that helps explain important properties of gene expression. By integrating publicly available data sets, we observe that promoter-bound nucleosomes assume one of four discrete configurations that determine the active and silent transcriptional states of a gene, but not its expression level. In TATA-box-containing promoters, nucleosome architecture indicates the amount of transcriptional noise. We show that {\textgreater}20{\%} of genes switch promoter states upon changes in cellular conditions. The data suggest that DNA-binding transcription factors together with chromatin-remodeling enzymes are primarily responsible for the nucleosome architecture. Our model for promoter nucleosome architecture reconciles genome-scale findings with molecular studies; in doing so, we establish principles for nucleosome positioning and gene expression that apply not only to individual genes, but across the entire genome. The study provides a stepping stone for future models of transcriptional regulation that encompass the intricate interplay between cis- and trans-acting factors, chromatin, and the core transcriptional machinery.},

Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to disparate developmental stages.

However, identification of disease-causing variants within association loci remains a major challenge. Divergence in gene expression due to cis-regulatory variants in noncoding regions is central to disease susceptibility. We show that integrative computational analysis of phylogenetic conservation with a complexity assessment of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) can identify cis-regulatory variants and elucidate their mechanistic role in disease. Analysis of established type 2 diabetes risk loci revealed a striking clustering of distinct homeobox TFBS.

We hypothesized that systemic inflammatory signals in genome-wide blood gene expression can identify clinically important COPD-related disease subtypes, and we leveraged pre-existing gene interaction networks to guide unsupervised clustering of blood microarray expression data. Using network-informed non-negative matrix factorization, we analyzed genome-wide blood gene expression from 229 former smokers in the ECLIPSE Study, and we identified novel, clinically relevant molecular subtypes of COPD. These network-informed clusters were more stable and more strongly associated with measures of lung structure and function than clusters derived from a network-na{\"{i}}ve approach, and they were associated with subtype-specific enrichment for inflammatory and protein catabolic pathways. These clusters were successfully reproduced in an independent sample of 135 smokers from the COPDGene Study.},

Brief descriptions of the algorithms are presented, which are meant to be understandable by a reader not familiar with them before. A most trivial sample im-plementation of the named techniques was made by the author, and the comparison of their performance on the PU1 spam corpus is presented. Finally, some ideas are given of how to construct a practically useful spam filter using the discussed techniques. The article is related to the author's first attempt of applying the machine-learning techniques in practice, and may therefore be of interest primarily to those getting aquainted with machine-learning.},

We discover that TP inhibits TAK1 kinase activity by interfering with the formation of the TAK1-TAB1 complex, and the binding affinity of TP to TAB1 correlates highly with the inhibitory activity of TP against MAPK pathway activation in macrophages. We also find that the amino acid sequence between positions 373 and 502 of TAB1 is required for TP interaction.

abstract = {The covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins regulates protein localization and function. SUMOylation has recently been shown to modulate ion-channel function; however, the extent to which this affects native currents and cellular excitability remains to be determined. The voltage-dependent K(+) (Kv) channel Kv2.1 regulates pancreatic beta-cell excitability and insulin secretion. We found that YFP-tagged SUMO1 (SUMO1-YFP) can be immunoprecipitated with Kv2.1 when these two proteins are coexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, direct infusion of recombinant SUMO1 peptide or coexpression of SUMO1-YFP inhibited current through cloned Kv2.1 by 80{\%} and 48{\%}, respectively. Insulin-secreting cells express SUMO variants 1 and 3, and expression of the SUMO1-YFP in human beta-cells or insulinoma cells inhibited native Kv currents (by 49{\%} and 33{\%}, respectively). Inhibition of the channel resulted from an acceleration of channel inactivation and an inhibition of recovery from inactivation, resulting in the widening of beta-cell action potentials and a decreased firing frequency. Finally, these effects on channel function and excitability were augmented by the conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and rescued by the SUMO protease SENP1. Thus, protein SUMOylation can exert a strong inhibitory action on the voltage-dependent K(+) channel Kv2.1 and can regulate cellular excitability in native beta-cells.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Positive-sense RNA viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), hijack the intracellular membrane machinery for their own replication. The Rab18 protein, a member of the Rab GTPase family, key regulators of membrane trafficking, is located on the organelles involved in DENV infection, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs). In this study, we addressed the potential involvement of Rab18 in DENV infection by using cells overexpressing the wild-type, GTP-bound active form, or GDP-bound inactive form of Rab18 and cells with Rab18 knockdown. DENV replication, measured by viral protein, viral RNA, and viral progeny production, as well as LD induction, was reduced in cells with inactive Rab18 and in cells deprived of Rab18 expression, suggesting a positive role of Rab18 in the DENV life cycle. Interestingly, the interaction of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key lipogenic enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, with DENV NS3 protein relied on the conversion of the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form of Rab18. Furthermore, the targeting of FASN to sites participating in DENV infection, such as the ER and LDs, depends on functional Rab18. Thus, Rab18-mediated membrane trafficking of FASN and NS3 facilitates DENV replication, probably by ensuring a sufficient and coordinated lipid supply for membrane proliferation and arrangement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: Infection by dengue virus (DENV), an important mosquito-borne virus threatening ∼40{\%} of the world's population, can cause mild dengue fever or severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The pathogenesis mechanisms of DENV-related diseases are not clear, but high viral replication is believed to be a risk factor for the severe form of DENV infection. Thus, understanding the detailed mechanism of DENV replication might help address this devastating virus. Here, we found that Rab18, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking and located in the endoplasmic reticulum network and on the surfaces of lipid droplets, positively regulates DENV replication. The functional machinery of Rab18 is required to recruit the enzyme fatty acid synthase to sites of DENV replication and to interact with DENV NS3 protein to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, DENV usurps Rab18 to facilitate its own replication.},

We report that the dual bromodomain-containing protein BRWD1, which is essential for both male and female fertility, promotes haploid spermatid-specific transcription but has distinct roles in oocyte meiotic progression. Brwd1 deficiency caused down-regulation of ∼300 mostly spermatid-specific transcripts in testis, including nearly complete elimination of those encoding the protamines and transition proteins, but was not associated with global epigenetic changes in chromatin, which suggests that BRWD1 acts selectively. In females, Brwd1 ablation caused severe chromosome condensation and structural defects associated with abnormal telomere structure but only minor changes in gene expression at the germinal vesicle stage, including more than twofold overexpression of the histone methyltransferase MLL5 and LINE-1 elements transposons. Thus, loss of BRWD1 function interferes with the completion of oogenesis and spermatogenesis through sexually dimorphic mechanisms: it is essential in females for epigenetic control of meiotic chromosome stability and in males for haploid gene transcription during postmeiotic sperm differentiation.},

abstract = {A novel mutation, repro5, was isolated in a forward genetic screen for infertility mutations induced by ENU mutagenesis. Homozygous mutant mice were phenotypically normal but were infertile. Oocytes from mutant females appeared normal, but were severely maturation-defective in that they had reduced ability to progress to metaphase II (MII), and those reaching MII were unable to progress beyond the two pronuclei stage following in vitro fertilization (IVF). Mutant males exhibited defective spermiogenesis, resulting in oligoasthenoteratospermia. Genetic mapping, positional cloning, and complementation studies with a disruption allele led to the identification of a mutation in Brwd1 (Bromodomain and WD repeat domain containing 1) as the causative lesion. Bromodomain-containing proteins typically interact with regions of chromatin containing histones hyperacetylated at lysine residues, a characteristic of chromatin in early spermiogenesis before eventual replacement of histones by the protamines. Previous data indicated that Brwd1 is broadly expressed, encoding a putative transcriptional regulator that is believed to act on chromatin through interactions with the Brg1-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling pathway. Brwd1 represents one of a small number of genes whose elimination disrupts gametogenesis in both sexes after the major events of meiotic prophase I have been completed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Comprehensive crossfamily structural analysis identifies conserved and family-specific structural features that are necessary for specific acetylation-dependent substrate recognition. Screening of more than 30 representative BRDs against systematic histone-peptide arrays identifies new BRD substrates and reveals a strong influence of flanking posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, suggesting that BRDs recognize combinations of marks rather than singly acetylated sequences.

abstract = {We report the isolation and characterisation of the gene WDR9 (WD Repeat 9), located in the Down Syndrome critical region-2 (DCR-2) from the human chromosome 21. This gene spans 125 kb of genomic sequence and is organised in 41 exons and 40 introns. The WDR9 cDNA has a size of 13 kb and encodes for a putative protein of 2269 amino acids with a potential location in the nucleus. Expression analysis in different human adult tissues and in cultured cell lines indicates that the gene has several tissue-specific transcripts. The more significant protein signatures in the WDR9 protein sequence are for WD repeats, bromodomain, beta-ketoacyl synthases, and ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The WDR9 protein has a high similarity with the Mus musculus neuronal differentiation protein (NDRP) and a region of similarity with the region of the Yotiao protein that has been proposed to bind the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. The presence of protein-protein interaction domains as such the WD repeats, and the similarity of the WDR9 protein to regulatory proteins suggest a potential involvement in some of the clinical features associated to the DCR-2. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Evidence of the pathological roles of MMPs in various diseases, combined with their druggability, has made them attractive therapeutic targets. Initial drug discovery efforts focused on the roles of MMPs in cancer progression, and more than 50 MMP inhibitors have been investigated in clinical trials in various cancers. However, all of these trials failed. Reasons for failure include the lack of inhibitor specificity and insufficient knowledge about the complexity of the disease biology. MMPs are also known to be involved in several inflammatory processes, and there are new therapeutic opportunities for MMP inhibitors to treat such diseases. In this Review, we discuss the recent advances made in understanding the role of MMPs in inflammatory diseases and the therapeutic potential of MMP inhibition in those conditions.},

Although early programs targeting MMPs were largely unsuccessful in clinical trials, they remain a viable and highly desirable therapeutic target based on preclinical studies and their role in disease progression. As information regarding the structure and function of these proteinases is compiled and biotechnology evolves, tools to develop better inhibitors are within our grasp. Improved methods for high throughput screening and in silico drug design programs have identified compounds which are highly potent, have high binding affinities, and exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. More recently, advances in drug delivery methods or compounds which bind outside the active site have brought new light to the field. In this review, we highlight the role of MMPs in cancer, clinical trials for MMP inhibitors, and novel approaches to targeting MMPs in cancer.},

They have multiple signalling activities that are commonly altered during tumorigenesis and that might serve as intervention points for anticancer drugs. However, there are many criteria to consider in validating MMPs as drug targets and for the development of MMP inhibitors. The inhibition of some MMPs could have pro-tumorigenic effects (making them anti-targets), counterbalancing the benefits of target inhibition.

@article{Burrage2006,
abstract = {The irreversible destruction of the cartilage, tendon, and bone that comprise synovial joints is the hallmark of both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). While cartilage is made up of proteoglycans and type II collagen, tendon and bone are composed primarily of type I collagen. RA is an autoimmune disease afflicting numerous joints throughout the body; in contrast, OA develops in a small number of joints, usually resulting from chronic overuse or injury. In both diseases, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that can degrade all components of the extracellular matrix. The collagenases, MMP-1 and MMP-13, have predominant roles in RA and OA because they are rate limiting in the process of collagen degradation. MMP-1 is produced primarily by the synovial cells that line the joints, and MMP-13 is a product of the chondrocytes that reside in the cartilage. In addition to collagen, MMP-13 also degrades the proteoglycan molecule, aggrecan, giving it a dual role in matrix destruction. Expression of other MMPs such as MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, is also elevated in arthritis and these enzymes degrade non-collagen matrix components of the joints. Significant effort has been expended in attempts to design effective inhibitors of MMP activity and/or synthesis with the goal of curbing connective tissues destruction within the joints. To date, however, no effective clinical inhibitors exist. Increasing our knowledge of the crystal structures of these enzymes and of the signal transduction pathways and molecular mechanisms that control MMP gene expression may provide new opportunities for the development of therapeutics to prevent the joint destruction seen in arthritis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53{\%}) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

Successful employment of gene-expression signatures in the later stages of drug development depends on their linkage to clinically meaningful phenotypic characteristics and requires a biologically meaningful mechanism combined with a stringent statistical rigor. Much of the success in clinical drug development is hinged on predefining the signature genes for their fitness for purposes of application. Specific examples are highlighted to illustrate the breadth and depth of the potential utility of gene-expression signatures in drug discovery and clinical development to targeted therapeutics at the bedside.},

abstract = {The availability of sequenced genomes of human and many experimental animals necessitated the development of new technologies and powerful computational tools that are capable of exploiting these genomic data and ask intriguing questions about complex nature of biological processes. This gave impetus for developing whole genome approaches that can produce functional information of genes in the form of expression profiles and unscramble the relationships between variation in gene expression and the resulting physiological outcome. These profiles represent genetic fingerprints or catalogue of genes that characterize the cell or tissue being studied and provide a basis from which to begin an investigation of the underlying biology. Among the most powerful and versatile tools are high-density DNA microarrays to analyze the expression patterns of large numbers of genes across different tissues or within the same tissue under a variety of experimental conditions or even between species. The wide spread use of microarray technologies is generating large sets of data that is stimulating the development of better analytical tools so that functions can be predicted for novel genes. In this review, the authors discuss how these profiles are being used at various stages of the drug discovery process and help in the identification of new drug targets, predict the function of novel genes, and understand individual variability in response to drugs.},

While traditional linkage analysis and modern high-throughput techniques often provide long lists of tens or hundreds of disease gene candidates, the identification of disease genes among the candidates remains time-consuming and expensive.

Compared to an average gene and its encoded protein(s), successful drug targets are more highly connected (but far from being the most highly connected), have higher betweenness values, lower entropies of tissue expression, and lower ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Furthermore, we have identified human tissues that are significantly over- or undertargeted relative to the full spectrum of genes that are active in each tissue. Our study provides quantitative guidelines that could aid in the computational screening of new drug targets in human cells.},

abstract = {The discovery of novel drug targets is a significant challenge in drug development. Although the human genome comprises approximately 30,000 genes, proteins encoded by fewer than 400 are used as drug targets in the treatment of diseases. Therefore, novel drug targets are extremely valuable as the source for first in class drugs. On the other hand, many of the currently known drug targets are functionally pleiotropic and involved in multiple pathologies. Several of them are exploited for treating multiple diseases, which highlights the need for methods to reliably reposition drug targets to new indications. Network-based methods have been successfully applied to prioritize novel disease-associated genes. In recent years, several such algorithms have been developed, some focusing on local network properties only, and others taking the complete network topology into account. Common to all approaches is the understanding that novel disease-associated candidates are in close overall proximity to known disease genes. However, the relevance of these methods to the prediction of novel drug targets has not yet been assessed. Here, we present a network-based approach for the prediction of drug targets for a given disease. The method allows both repositioning drug targets known for other diseases to the given disease and the prediction of unexploited drug targets which are not used for treatment of any disease. Our approach takes as input a disease gene expression signature and a high-quality interaction network and outputs a prioritized list of drug targets. We demonstrate the high performance of our method and highlight the usefulness of the predictions in three case studies. We present novel drug targets for scleroderma and different types of cancer with their underlying biological processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our method to identify non-suspected repositioning candidates using diabetes type 1 as an example.},

abstract = {Polypharmacology, which focuses on designing drugs that bind efficiently to multiple targets, has emerged as a new strategic trend in today's drug discovery research. Many successful drugs achieve their effects via multi-target interactions. However, these targets are largely unknown for both marketed drugs and drugs in development. A better knowledge of a drug's mode of action could be of substantial value to future drug development, in particular for side effect prediction and drug repositioning. We propose a network-based computational method for drug target prediction, applicable on a genome-wide scale. Our approach relies on the analysis of gene expression following drug treatment in the context of a functional protein association network. By diffusing differential expression signals to neighboring or correlated nodes in the network, genes are prioritized as potential targets based on the transcriptional response of functionally related genes. Different diffusion strategies were evaluated on 235 publicly available gene expression datasets for treatment with bioactive molecules having a known target. AUC values of up to more than 90{\%} demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and indicate the predictive power of integrating experimental gene expression data with prior knowledge from protein association networks.},

abstract = {Identifying potential drug target proteins is a crucial step in the process of drug discovery and plays a key role in the study of the molecular mechanisms of disease. Based on the fact that the majority of proteins exert their functions through interacting with each other, we propose a method to recognize target proteins by using the human protein-protein interaction network and graph theory. In the network, vertexes and edges are weighted by using the confidence scores of interactions and descriptors of protein primary structure, respectively. The novel network topological features are defined and employed to characterize protein using existing databases. A widely used minimum redundancy maximum relevance and random forests algorithm are utilized to select the optimal feature subset and construct model for the identification of potential drug target proteins at the proteome scale. The accuracies of training set and test set are 89.55{\%} and 85.23{\%}. Using the constructed model, 2127 potential drug target proteins have been recognized and 156 drug target proteins have been validated in the database of drug target. In addition, some new drug target proteins can be considered as targets for treating diseases of mucopolysaccharidosis, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, Bernard-Soulier syndrome and pseudo-von Willebrand, etc. It is anticipated that the proposed method may became a powerful high-throughput virtual screening tool of drug target.},

abstract = {Analyzing topological properties of drug-target proteins in the biology network is very helpful in understanding the mechanism of drug action. However, comprehensive studies to elaborately characterize the biological network features of drug-target proteins are still lacking. In this paper, we compared the topological properties of drug-targets with those of the non-drug-target sets, by mapping the drug-targets in DrugBank to the human protein interaction network. The results indicate that the topological properties of drug-targets are significantly distinguishable from those of non-drug-targets. Moreover, the potential possibility of drug-target prediction based on these properties is discussed. All proteins in the interaction network were ranked by their topological properties. Among the top 200 proteins, 94 overlapped with drug-targets in DrugBank and some novel predictions were found to be drug-targets in public literatures and other databases. In conclusion, our method explores the topological properties of drug-targets in the human protein interaction network by exploiting the large-scale drug-targets and protein interaction data.},

The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16{\%}. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The DISEASES resource is accessible through a web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download.},

abstract = {COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer. Our latest release (v70; Aug 2014) describes 2 002 811 coding point mutations in over one million tumor samples and across most human genes. To emphasize depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and patient details. Combination of almost 20 000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of mutations and biomarkers across cancer patient populations. Conversely, our curation of cancer genomes (over 12 000) emphasizes knowledge breadth, driving discovery of unrecognized cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. In addition, COSMIC also details more than six million noncoding mutations, 10 534 gene fusions, 61 299 genome rearrangements, 695 504 abnormal copy number segments and 60 119 787 abnormal expression variants. All these types of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and mutation types.},

abstract = {UniProt is an important collection of protein sequences and their annotations, which has doubled in size to 80 million sequences during the past year. This growth in sequences has prompted an extension of UniProt accession number space from 6 to 10 characters. An increasing fraction of new sequences are identical to a sequence that already exists in the database with the majority of sequences coming from genome sequencing projects. We have created a new proteome identifier that uniquely identifies a particular assembly of a species and strain or subspecies to help users track the provenance of sequences. We present a new website that has been designed using a user-experience design process. We have introduced an annotation score for all entries in UniProt to represent the relative amount of knowledge known about each protein. These scores will be helpful in identifying which proteins are the best characterized and most informative for comparative analysis. All UniProt data is provided freely and is available on the web at http://www.uniprot.org/.},

abstract = {In traditional text classification, a classifier is built using labeled training documents of every class. This paper studies a different problem. Given a set P of documents of a particular class (called positive class) and a set U of unlabeled documents that contains documents from class P and also other types of documents (called negative class documents), we want to build a classifier to classify the documents in U into documents from P and documents not from P. The key feature of this problem is that there is no labeled negative document, which makes traditional text classification techniques inapplicable. In this paper, we propose an effective technique to solve the problem. It combines the Rocchio method and the SVM technique for classifier building. Experimental results show that the new method outperforms ex- isting methods significantly.},

The aggregation av-erages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality v ote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classiication and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability o f the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause signiicant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract$\backslash$n$\backslash$nextension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndecision-theoretic setting.

abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for ruining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

However these techniques fail when applied on real world face images. The proposed technique effectively extracts the prominent facial features. Most of the features are redundant and do not contribute to representing face. In order to eliminate those redundant features, computationally efficient algorithm is used to select the more discriminative face features. Extracted features are then passed to classification step. In the classification step, different classifiers are ensemble to enhance the recognition accuracy rate as single classifier is unable to achieve the high accuracy. Experiments are performed on standard face database images and results are compared with existing techniques.},

Bayes C outperformed G-BLUP in the prediction of HDL, which is influenced by loci of moderate size, in the UK data.

Therefore, the quantity of interest is not directly obtained and a number of preprocessing procedures are necessary to convert the raw data into the format with biological relevance. This also makes exploratory data analysis and visualization essential steps to detect possible defects, anomalies or distortion of the data, to test underlying assumptions and thus ensure data quality. The characteristics of the data structure revealed in exploratory analysis often motivate decisions in preprocessing procedures to produce data suitable for downstream analysis. In this chapter we review the common techniques in exploring and visualizing high-dimensional data and introduce the basic preprocessing procedures.},

Ontologies provide annotation solutions; however, for cross-domain investigations, multiple ontologies are needed to represent the data.

RESULTS We present the Experimental Factor Ontology, designed to meet cross-domain, application focused use cases for gene expression data. We describe our methodology and open source tools used to create the ontology. These include tools for creating ontology mappings, ontology views, detecting ontology changes and using ontologies in interfaces to enhance querying. The application of reference ontologies to data is a key problem, and this work presents guidelines on how community ontologies can be presented in an application ontology in a data-driven way.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The genome-wide identification of both morbid genes, i.e., those genes whose mutations cause hereditary human diseases, and druggable genes, i.e., genes coding for proteins whose modulation by small molecules elicits phenotypic effects, requires experimental approaches that are time-consuming and laborious. Thus, a computational approach which could accurately predict such genes on a genome-wide scale would be invaluable for accelerating the pace of discovery of causal relationships between genes and diseases as well as the determination of druggability of gene products. RESULTS In this paper we propose a machine learning-based computational approach to predict morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale. For this purpose, we constructed a decision tree-based meta-classifier and trained it on datasets containing, for each morbid and druggable gene, network topological features, tissue expression profile and subcellular localization data as learning attributes. This meta-classifier correctly recovered 65{\%} of known morbid genes with a precision of 66{\%} and correctly recovered 78{\%} of known druggable genes with a precision of 75{\%}. It was than used to assign morbidity and druggability scores to genes not known to be morbid and druggable and we showed a good match between these scores and literature data. Finally, we generated decision trees by training the J48 algorithm on the morbidity and druggability datasets to discover cellular rules for morbidity and druggability and, among the rules, we found that the number of regulating transcription factors and plasma membrane localization are the most important factors to morbidity and druggability, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We were able to demonstrate that network topological features along with tissue expression profile and subcellular localization can reliably predict human morbid and druggable genes on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, by constructing decision trees based on these data, we could discover cellular rules governing morbidity and druggability.},

Based on 443 sequence-derived protein features, we applied the most commonly used machine learning methods to predict whether a protein is druggable as well as to opt for superior algorithm in this task. In addition, feature selection procedures were used to provide the best performance of each classifier according to the optimum number of features. When run on all features, Neural Network was the best classifier, with 89.98{\%} accuracy, based on a k-fold cross-validation test. Among all the algorithms applied, the optimum number of most-relevant features was 130, according to the Support Vector Machine-Feature Selection (SVM-FS) algorithm. This study resulted in the discovery of new drug target which potentially can be employed in cell signaling pathways, gene expression, and signal transduction.

abstract = {The emergence of -omics technologies has allowed the collection of vast amounts of data on biological systems. Although, the pace of such collection has been exponential, the impact of these data remains small on many critical biomedical applications such as drug development. Limited resources, high costs, and low hit-to-lead ratio have led researchers to search for more cost effective methodologies. A possible alternative is to incorporate computational methods of potential drug target prediction early during drug discovery workflow. Computational methods based on systems approaches have the advantage of taking into account the global properties of a molecule not limited to its sequence, structure or function. Machine learning techniques are powerful tools that can extract relevant information from massive and noisy data sets. In recent years the scientific community has explored the combined power of these fields to propose increasingly accurate and low cost methods to propose interesting drug targets. In this mini-review, we describe promising approaches based on the simultaneous use of systems biology and machine learning to access gene and protein druggability. Moreover, we discuss the state-of-the-art of this emerging and interdisciplinary field, discussing data sources, algorithms and the performance of the different methodologies. Finally, we indicate interesting avenues of research and some remaining open challenges.},

Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

Here we performed simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analysis on purified intestinal epithelial cells derived from human fetal gut, healthy pediatric biopsies, and children newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Results were validated using pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, and immunostaining. The functional impact of DNA methylation changes on gene expression was assessed by employing in-vitro assays in intestinal cell lines. DNA methylation analyses allowed identification of 214 genes for which expression is regulated via DNA methylation, i.e. regulatory differentially methylated regions (rDMRs). Pathway and functional analysis of rDMRs suggested a critical role for DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and functional development of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, analysis performed on intestinal epithelium of children newly diagnosed with IBD revealed alterations in DNA methylation within genomic loci, which were found to overlap significantly with those undergoing methylation changes during intestinal development. Our study provides novel insights into the physiological role of DNA methylation in regulating functional maturation of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, we provide data linking developmentally acquired alterations in the DNA methylation profile to changes seen in pediatric IBD.Mucosal Immunology advance online publication, 16 September 2015; doi:10.1038/mi.2015.88.},

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

Here, we integrate chromatin profiling for three histone marks in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 75 sequenced individuals with LCL-specific Hi-C and ChIA-PET-based chromatin contact maps to uncover one of the largest collections of local and distal histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). Distal QTLs are enriched within topologically associated domains and exhibit largely concordant variation of chromatin state coordinated by proximal and distal non-coding genetic variants. Histone QTLs are enriched for common variants associated with autoimmune diseases and enable identification of putative target genes of disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studies. These analyses provide insights into how genetic variation can affect human disease phenotypes by coordinated changes in chromatin at interacting regulatory elements.},

This problem, often referred to as PU learning, differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We propose a new method for PU learning with a conceptually simple implementation based on bootstrap aggregating (bagging) techniques: the algorithm iteratively trains many binary classifiers to discriminate the known positive examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set, and averages their predictions. We show theoretically and experimentally that the method can match and even outperform the performance of state-of-the-art methods for PU learning, particularly when the number of positive examples is limited and the fraction of negatives among the unlabeled examples is small. The proposed method can also run considerably faster than state-of-the-art methods, particularly when the set of unlabeled examples is large. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Regulatory elements can affect specific genes from megabase distances, often from within or beyond unrelated neighbouring genes. The task of computational charting of regulatory inputs in the genome can be approached from several directions. Typically, computational identification of putative regulatory elements for a gene of interest requires tools that will aid in estimating the extent of the (potentially vast) genomic region around the gene that is likely to contain regulatory elements, as well as tools for the identification and characterization of individual elements. Conversely, starting from a putative regulatory element or a regulatory variation in a non-coding region, one often wants to associate the regulatory element with the correct target gene(s). The design of tools for these purposes relies on the remarkably high level of sequence conservation of thousands of regulatory enhancers, their strong tendency to cluster around their target genes, as well as a constrained range of functional categories of the corresponding target genes, many of which are developmental regulators. Additional evolutionary information, such as conservation of synteny, and a growing body of functional genomic and epigenomic data are being rapidly added to established and emerging tools for studying developmental regulation and cross-species conservation to provide new functional insights into the roles of these regions. In this article, we give an overview of the functionality available in general purpose and new/specialized web tools for the above tasks, and discuss current and future developments in the field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nuclear receptors are a large structural class of transcription factors that act with their co-regulators and repressors to maintain a variety of biological and physiological processes such as metabolism, development and reproduction. They are activated through the binding of small ligands, which can be replaced by drug molecules, making nuclear receptors promising drug targets. Transcriptional regulation of the genes that encode them is central to gaining a deeper understanding of the diversity of their biochemical and biophysical roles and their role in disease and therapy. Even though they share evolutionary history, nuclear receptor genes have fundamentally different expression patterns, ranging from ubiquitously expressed to tissue-specific and spatiotemporally complex. However, current understanding of regulation in nuclear receptor gene family is still nascent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigate the relationship between long-range regulation of nuclear receptor family and their known functionality. Towards this goal, we identify the nuclear receptor genes that are potential targets based on counts of highly conserved non-coding elements. We validate our results using publicly available expression (RNA-seq) and histone modification (ChIP-seq) data from the ENCODE project. We find that nuclear receptor genes involved in developmental roles show strong evidence of long-range mechanism of transcription regulation with distinct cis-regulatory content they feature clusters of highly conserved non-coding elements distributed in regions spanning several Megabases, long and multiple CpG islands, bivalent promoter marks and statistically significant higher enrichment of enhancer mark around their gene loci. On the other hand nuclear receptor genes that are involved in tissue-specific roles lack these features, having simple transcriptional controls and a greater variety of mechanisms for producing paralogs. We further examine the combinatorial patterns of histone maps associated with dynamic functional elements in order to explore the regulatory landscape of the gene family. The results show that our proposed classification capturing long-range regulation is strongly indicative of the functional roles of the nuclear receptors compared to existing classifications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We present a new classification for nuclear receptor gene family capturing whether a nuclear receptor is a possible target of long-range regulation or not. We compare our classification to existing structural (mechanism of action) and homology-based classifications. Our results show that understanding long-range regulation of nuclear receptors can provide key insight into their functional roles as well as evolutionary history; and this strongly merits further study.},

abstract = {Altered DNA methylation occurs ubiquitously in human cancer from the earliest measurable stages. A cogent approach to understanding the mechanism and timing of altered DNA methylation is to analyze it in the context of carcinogenesis by a defined agent. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human oncogenic herpesvirus associated with lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but also used commonly in the laboratory to immortalize human B-cells in culture. Here we have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B-cells, activated B-cells, and EBV-immortalized B-cells from the same three individuals, in order to identify the impact of transformation on the methylome. Surprisingly, large-scale hypomethylated blocks comprising two-thirds of the genome were induced by EBV immortalization but not by B-cell activation per se. These regions largely corresponded to hypomethylated blocks that we have observed in human cancer, and they were associated with gene-expression hypervariability, similar to human cancer, and consistent with a model of epigenomic change promoting tumor cell heterogeneity. We also describe small-scale changes in DNA methylation near CpG islands. These results suggest that methylation disruption is an early and critical step in malignant transformation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark implicated in many biological processes of direct clinical relevance. Although sequencing-based technologies are increasingly allowing high-resolution measurements of DNA methylation, statistical modelling of such data is still challenging. In particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for spatial correlations within the statistical testing procedure. RESULTS: We propose a non-parametric, kernel-based method, M(3)D, to detect higher order changes in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre-defined regions. The test statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between samples, thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis of methylation data. Empirical tests on real and simulated datasets show an increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable robustness with respect to coverage and replication levels.

abstract = {Identifying novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of disease is challenging. To this end, we developed a genome-wide approach of candidate gene prioritization. We independently collocated sets of genes that were implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenicity through three genome-wide assays: (i) genome-wide association studies (GWAS), (ii) differentially expression in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and (iii) differentially methylation in RA FLS. Integrated analysis of these complementary data sets identified a significant enrichment of multi-evidence genes (MEGs) within pathways relating to RA pathogenicity. One MEG is Engulfment and Cell Motility Protein-1 (ELMO1), a gene not previously considered as a therapeutic target in RA FLS. We demonstrated in RA FLS that ELMO1 is: (i) expressed, (ii) promotes cell migration and invasion, and (iii) regulates Rac1 activity. Thus, we created links between ELMO1 and RA pathogenicity, which in turn validates ELMO1 as a potential RA therapeutic target. This study illustrated the power of MEG-based approaches for therapeutic target identification.},

@article{Yang2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying disease genes from human genome is an important but challenging task in biomedical research. Machine learning methods can be applied to discover new disease genes based on the known ones. Existing machine learning methods typically use the known disease genes as the positive training set P and the unknown genes as the negative training set N (non-disease gene set does not exist) to build classifiers to identify new disease genes from the unknown genes. However, such kind of classifiers is actually built from a noisy negative set N as there can be unknown disease genes in N itself. As a result, the classifiers do not perform as well as they could be.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Instead of treating the unknown genes as negative examples in N, we treat them as an unlabeled set U. We design a novel positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithm PUDI (PU learning for disease gene identification) to build a classifier using P and U. We first partition U into four sets, namely, reliable negative set RN, likely positive set LP, likely negative set LN and weak negative set WN. The weighted support vector machines are then used to build a multi-level classifier based on the four training sets and positive training set P to identify disease genes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PUDI algorithm outperformed the existing methods significantly. Conclusion: The proposed PUDI algorithm is able to identify disease genes more accurately by treating the unknown data more appropriately as unlabeled set U instead of negative set N. Given that many machine learning problems in biomedical research do involve positive and unlabeled data instead of negative data, it is possible that the machine learning methods for these problems can be further improved by adopting PU learning methods, as we have done here for disease gene identification. Availability and implementation: The executable program and data are available at http://www1.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/{\~{}}xlli/PUDI/PUDI.html.},

However, in some domains only positive and unlabeled examples are available, which prohibits the use of most standard evaluation metrics. We propose an approach to estimate any metric based on contingency tables, including ROC and PR curves, using only positive and unlabeled data. Estimating these performance metrics is essentially reduced to estimating the fraction of (latent) positives in the unlabeled set, assuming known positives are a random sample of all positives. We provide theoretical bounds on the quality of our estimates, illustrate the importance of estimating the fraction of positives in the unlabeled set and demonstrate empirically that we are able to reliably estimate ROC and PR curves on real data.},

@book{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

To our knowledge, the only hereditary condition known to be caused by a miRNA is a form of adult-onset non-syndromic deafness, and no miRNA mutation has yet been found to be responsible for any developmental defect in humans. Here we report the identification of germline hemizygous deletions of MIR17HG, encoding the miR-1792 polycistronic miRNA cluster, in individuals with microcephaly, short stature and digital abnormalities. We demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of miR-1792 is responsible for these developmental abnormalities by showing that mice harboring targeted deletion of the miR-1792 cluster phenocopy several key features of the affected humans. These findings identify a regulatory function for miR-1792 in growth and skeletal development and represent the first example of an miRNA gene responsible for a syndromic developmental defect in humans.},

Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns. Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic contexts varies substantially among human tissues.},

abstract = {The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). Here we review the identification and composition of super-enhancers, describe links between super-enhancers, gene regulation and disease, and discuss the functional significance of enhancer clustering. We also provide our perspective regarding the proposition that super-enhancers are a regulatory entity conceptually distinct from what was known before the introduction of the term. Our opinion is that there is not yet strong evidence that super-enhancers are a novel paradigm in gene regulation and that use of the term in this context is not currently justified. However, the term likely identifies strong enhancers that exhibit behaviors consistent with previous models and concepts of transcriptional regulation. In this respect, the super-enhancer definition is useful in identifying regulatory elements likely to control genes important for cell type specification.},

abstract = {Most variants implicated in common human disease by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in noncoding sequence intervals. Despite the suggestion that regulatory element disruption represents a common theme, identifying causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based computational method to predict the effect of regulatory variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) that encodes cell type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays. Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores, and we predict new risk-conferring SNPs for several autoimmune diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational approach to systematically identify functional regulatory variants.},

This problem is routinely cast as a supervised task with label noise in the negative set. We use an ensemble of SVM models trained on bootstrap subsamples of the training data for increased robustness against label noise. The approach can be considered in a bagging framework which provides an intuitive explanation for its mechanics in a semi-supervised setting. We compared our method to state-of-the-art approaches in a simulation based on the MNIST digit recognition data set. The included benchmark comprises three settings with increasing label noise: (i) fully supervised, (ii) PU learning and (iii) PU learning with false positives. Our approach shows a marginal improvement over existing methods in the second setting and a significant improvement in the third.},

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

Growing insight into genes that influence human disease may affect how drug targets and indications are selected. However, there is little guidance about how much weight should be given to genetic evidence in making these key decisions. To answer this question, we investigated how well the current archive of genetic evidence predicts drug mechanisms. We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0{\%} at the preclinical stage to 8.2{\%} among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development. Therefore, using the growing wealth of human genetic data to select the best targets and indications should have a measurable impact on the successful development of new drugs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sox proteins encompass an evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors with critical roles in animal development and stem cell biology. In common with vertebrates, the Drosophila group B proteins SoxNeuro and Dichaete are involved in central nervous system development, where they play both similar and unique roles in gene regulation. Sox genes show extensive functional redundancy across metazoans, but the molecular basis underpinning functional compensation mechanisms at the genomic level are currently unknown.

RESULTS: Using a combination of genome-wide binding analysis and gene expression profiling, we show that SoxNeuro directs embryonic neural development from the early specification of neuroblasts through to the terminal differentiation of neurons and glia. To address the issue of functional redundancy and compensation at a genomic level, we compare SoxNeuro and Dichaete binding, identifying common and independent binding events in wild-type conditions, as well as instances of compensation and loss of binding in mutant backgrounds.

CONCLUSIONS: We find that early aspects of group B Sox functions in the central nervous system, such as stem cell maintenance and dorsoventral patterning, are highly conserved. However, in contrast to vertebrates, we find that Drosophila group B1 proteins also play prominent roles during later aspects of neural morphogenesis. Our analysis of the functional relationship between SoxNeuro and Dichaete uncovers evidence for redundant and independent functions for each protein, along with unexpected examples of compensation and interdependency, thus providing new insights into the general issue of transcription factor functional redundancy.},

In these studies, expression levels are viewed as quantitative traits, and gene expression phenotypes are mapped to particular genomic loci by combining studies of variation in gene expression patterns with genome-wide genotyping. Results from recent eQTL mapping studies have revealed substantial heritable variation in gene expression within and between populations. In many cases, genetic factors that influence gene expression levels can be mapped to proximal (putatively cis) eQTLs and, less often, to distal (putatively trans) eQTLs. Beyond providing great insight into the biology of gene regulation, a combination of eQTL studies with results from traditional linkage or association studies of human disease may help predict a specific regulatory role for polymorphic sites previously associated with disease.},

abstract = {Regulatory factor binding to genomic DNA protects the underlying sequence from cleavage by DNase I, leaving nucleotide-resolution footprints. Using genomic DNase I footprinting across 41 diverse cell and tissue types, we detected 45 million transcription factor occupancy events within regulatory regions, representing differential binding to 8.4 million distinct short sequence elements. Here we show that this small genomic sequence compartment, roughly twice the size of the exome, encodes an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins that nearly doubles the size of the human cis-regulatory lexicon. We find that genetic variants affecting allelic chromatin states are concentrated in footprints, and that these elements are preferentially sheltered from DNA methylation. High-resolution DNase I cleavage patterns mirror nucleotide-level evolutionary conservation and track the crystallographic topography of protein-DNA interfaces, indicating that transcription factor structure has been evolutionarily imprinted on the human genome sequence. We identify a stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint that precisely defines the site of transcript origination within thousands of human promoters. Finally, we describe a large collection of novel regulatory factor recognition motifs that are highly conserved in both sequence and function, and exhibit cell-selective occupancy patterns that closely parallel major regulators of development, differentiation and pluripotency.},

abstract = {FOXO3 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of multiple physiological processes including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, oxidative stress-response and energy metabolism. Although much is known about its post-translational modification, the transcriptional regulation of FOXO3, as well as the cross-talk between transcription and post-translational events, is still poorly understood. In the present study, we show that FOXO3 is an immediate early glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target, whose transcription is even further enhanced by conditions that mimic metabolic stress. Induction of FOXO3 transcription by GR-binding steroids was reversed by concomitant treatment with the GR antagonist RU-486, but further enhanced by stimuli that activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Analysis of genomic DNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation, as well as luciferase reporter assays, revealed two functional glucocorticoid responsive elements within the FOXO3 promoter. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence for a phosphorylation switch that explains how glucocorticoids induce transcriptional activation of the gene but subsequently inactivate the corresponding protein by site-specific phosphorylation. Only when AMPK is stimulated, pre-existing FOXO3 becomes reverted toward an active form. Energy deprived conditions thus activate FOXO3 on two different levels, namely transcriptional and post-translational. In that way, FOXO3 acts as a metabolic stress sensor that coordinates expression of LKB1, the master upstream kinase involved in metabolic sensing, depending on the energy status of the cell. Additionally, we show that FOXO3 binds and activates its own promoter via a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. In conclusion, our data explain how catabolic glucocorticoid hormones and high intracellular AMP levels cooperate in inducing FOXO3 transcription and in activating the corresponding protein.},

abstract = {Forkhead box class O 3a (FOXO3) is a member of the FoxO transcription factor subfamily, which regulates the expression of target genes not only through DNA binding as a transcription factor, but also through protein-protein interaction. Although FoxO3 is a well-known transcription factor involved in diverse biological processes, the role of FoxO3 in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced lung inflammation and injury has not been studied. It is, therefore, hypothesized that deficiency of FoxO3 leads to increased susceptibility to CS-induced lung inflammatory response and airspace enlargement. In this article, we show that the levels of FOXO3 are significantly decreased in lungs of smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as in lungs of mice exposed to CS. Genetic ablation of FoxO3 led to pulmonary emphysema and exaggerated inflammatory response in lungs of mice exposed to CS. We further showed that CS induced the translocation of FoxO3 into the nucleus where FoxO3 interacted with NF-$\kappa$B and disrupted NF-$\kappa$B DNA-binding ability, leading to inhibition of its activity. Targeted disruption of FoxO3 also resulted in downregulation of antioxidant genes in mouse lungs in response to CS exposure. These results suggest that FoxO3 plays a pivotal role in regulation of lung inflammatory response and antioxidant genes, and deficiency of FoxO3 results in development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.},

abstract = {Bacterial pathogens are a leading cause of lung infections and contribute to acute exacerbations in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The innate immune system of the respiratory tract controls and prevents colonization of the lung with bacterial pathogens. Forkhead box transcription factor family O (FOXO) transcription factors are key regulators of cellular metabolism, proliferation, and stress resistance. In this study, our aim was to investigate the role of FOXO transcription factors in innate immune functions of respiratory epithelial cells. We show that bacterial pathogens potently activate FOXO transcription factors in cultured human respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. Infection of mice with bacterial pathogens resulted in the activation of FOXO transcription factors in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vivo. Active FOXO was also detectable in human bronchial tissue obtained from subjects with different infection-related lung diseases. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO in bronchial epithelial cells resulted in reduced expression of factors of the innate immune system such as antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines, both under basal conditions and upon infection. FOXO deficiency further affected internalization of Haemophilus influenzae in bronchial epithelial cells. Finally, we show that TLR3 activates innate immune responses in a FOXO-dependent manner. In conclusion, FOXO transcription factors are involved in the cellular responses to bacterial stimuli and act as central regulators of innate immune functions in respiratory epithelial cells.},

abstract = {BET family proteins are epigenetic regulators known to control expression of genes involved in cell growth and oncogenesis. Selective inhibitors of BET proteins exhibit potent anti-proliferative activity in a number of hematologic cancer models, in part through suppression of the MYC oncogene and downstream Myc-driven pathways. However, little is currently known about the activity of BET inhibitors in solid tumor models, and whether down-regulation of MYC family genes contributes to sensitivity. Here we provide evidence for potent BET inhibitor activity in neuroblastoma, a pediatric solid tumor associated with a high frequency of MYCN amplifications. We treated a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with a novel small molecule inhibitor of BET proteins, GSK1324726A (I-BET726), and observed potent growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in most cell lines irrespective of MYCN copy number or expression level. Gene expression analyses in neuroblastoma cell lines suggest a role of BET inhibition in apoptosis, signaling, and N-Myc-driven pathways, including the direct suppression of BCL2 and MYCN. Reversal of MYCN or BCL2 suppression reduces the potency of I-BET726-induced cytotoxicity in a cell line-specific manner; however, neither factor fully accounts for I-BET726 sensitivity. Oral administration of I-BET726 to mouse xenograft models of human neuroblastoma results in tumor growth inhibition and down-regulation MYCN and BCL2 expression, suggesting a potential role for these genes in tumor growth. Taken together, our data highlight the potential of BET inhibitors as novel therapeutics for neuroblastoma, and suggest that sensitivity is driven by pleiotropic effects on cell growth and apoptotic pathways in a context-specific manner.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) epigenetic readers may have clinical utility against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we validate this hypothesis, demonstrating the efficacy of the BET inhibitor I-BET151 across a variety of AML subtypes driven by disparate mutations. We demonstrate that a common 'core' transcriptional program, which is HOX gene independent, is downregulated in AML and underlies sensitivity to I-BET treatment. This program is enriched for genes that contain 'super-enhancers', recently described regulatory elements postulated to control key oncogenic driver genes. Moreover, our program can independently classify AML patients into distinct cytogenetic and molecular subgroups, suggesting that it contains biomarkers of sensitivity and response. We focus AML with mutations of the Nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) and show evidence to suggest that wild-type NPM1 has an inhibitory influence on BRD4 that is relieved upon NPM1c mutation and cytosplasmic dislocation. This leads to the upregulation of the core transcriptional program facilitating leukemia development. This program is abrogated by I-BET therapy and by nuclear restoration of NPM1. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of I-BET151 in a unique murine model and in primary patient samples of NPM1c AML. Taken together, our data support the use of BET inhibitors in clinical trials in AML.},

So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic 'writers' and 'erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein-protein interactions of epigenetic 'readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin accessibility impact transcription factor binding to DNA and transcriptional specificity. The androgen receptor (AR), a master regulator of the male phenotype and prostate cancer pathogenesis, acts primarily through ligand-activated transcription of target genes. Although several determinants of AR transcriptional specificity have been elucidated, our understanding of the interplay between chromatin accessibility and AR function remains incomplete. RESULTS: We used deep sequencing to assess chromatin structure via DNase I hypersensitivity and mRNA abundance, and paired these datasets with three independent AR ChIP-seq datasets. Our analysis revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in chromatin accessibility that corresponded to both AR binding and an enrichment of motifs for potential collaborating factors, one of which was identified as SP1. These quantitative differences were significantly associated with AR-regulated mRNA transcription across the genome. Base-pair resolution of the DNase I cleavage profile revealed three distinct footprinting patterns associated with the AR-DNA interaction, suggesting multiple modes of AR interaction with the genome. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with other DNA-binding factors, AR binding to the genome does not only target regions that are accessible to DNase I cleavage prior to hormone induction. AR binding is invariably associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and, consequently, changes in gene expression. Furthermore, we present the first in vivo evidence that a significant fraction of AR binds only to half of the full AR DNA motif. These findings indicate a dynamic quantitative relationship between chromatin structure and AR-DNA binding that impacts AR transcriptional specificity.},

abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, RegulomeDB, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. RegulomeDB includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from ENCODE and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a GWAS where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.},

abstract = {Our recent study demonstrated that defects in p110delta result in B-cell immunodeficiency that is very similar to that observed in BTK-deficient mice. We revealed that the p110delta fit the B-cell signal transduction complex and played a non-redundant role in the development and function of B cells. In humans, most children with primary B-cell immunodeficiency have mutations in the BTK, whereas a few have defects in the components of the B-cell signal transduction complex. But little is known about the genetic variation of p110delta in children with defects in B-cell immunodeficiency of unknown aetiology. Sixteen patients from 15 unrelated families and 112 normal controls underwent sequence analysis to identify genetic variations of the p110delta. Allele frequency in each group was also analysed and compared. We identified five single base-pair polymorphic nucleotide exchanges in both patient and control groups with similar allele frequencies, which did not contribute to the immunodeficiency. Three of them are novel (m.953A{\textgreater}G, m.1200C{\textgreater}T and m.1561A{\textgreater}G), and the m.953A{\textgreater}G and m.1561A{\textgreater}G nucleotide exchanges are non-synonymous (N253S and T456A, respectively). The novel m.1561A{\textgreater}G was in complete linkage disequilibrium with the known m.873A{\textgreater}G in our study of Taiwanese group. In addition, one novel single base-pair missense mutation, m.3256G{\textgreater}A (E1021K), was identified in one boy with typical clinical features of primary B-cell immunodeficiency and could not be found in either his family or the normal control population. By atomic structural analysis of the amino acid as well as the alignment comparison between species, it resulted in the replacement of the negative-charged amino acid E with the positive-charged amino acid K at codon 1021, located in the highly conservative and important catalytic functional domain. Our findings could shed light on further understanding the polymorphisms of p110delta in B-cell immunodeficiency and different populations. Moreover, the 3256G{\textgreater}A missense mutation raised the attention and warranted further extensive analysis to elucidate the role of p110delta in human immunodeficiency.},

abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by the complex interaction of transcription factors binding to promoters and other regulatory DNA elements. One common characteristic of the genomic regions associated with regulatory proteins is a pronounced sensitivity to DNase I digestion. We generated genome-wide high-resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites from both seedling and callus tissues of rice (Oryza sativa). Approximately 25{\%} of the DH sites from both tissues were found in putative promoters, indicating that the vast majority of the gene regulatory elements in rice are not located in promoter regions. We found 58{\%} more DH sites in the callus than in the seedling. For DH sites detected in both the seedling and callus, 31{\%} displayed significantly different levels of DNase I sensitivity within the two tissues. Genes that are differentially expressed in the seedling and callus were frequently associated with DH sites in both tissues. The DNA sequences contained within the DH sites were hypomethylated, consistent with what is known about active gene regulatory elements. Interestingly, tissue-specific DH sites located in the promoters showed a higher level of DNA methylation than the average DNA methylation level of all the DH sites located in the promoters. A distinct elevation of H3K27me3 was associated with intergenic DH sites. These results suggest that epigenetic modifications play a role in the dynamic changes of the numbers and DNase I sensitivity of DH sites during development.},

Here, we describe activated PI3K-$\delta$ syndrome (APDS), a PID associated with a dominant gain-of-function mutation in which lysine replaced glutamic acid at residue 1021 (E1021K) in the p110$\delta$ protein, the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase $\delta$ (PI3K$\delta$), encoded by the PIK3CD gene. We found E1021K in 17 patients from seven unrelated families, but not among 3346 healthy subjects. APDS was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, progressive airway damage, lymphopenia, increased circulating transitional B cells, increased immunoglobulin M, and reduced immunoglobulin G2 levels in serum and impaired vaccine responses. The E1021K mutation enhanced membrane association and kinase activity of p110$\delta$. Patient-derived lymphocytes had increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphorylated AKT protein and were prone to activation-induced cell death. Selective p110$\delta$ inhibitors IC87114 and GS-1101 reduced the activity of the mutant enzyme in vitro, which suggested a therapeutic approach for patients with APDS.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis is a major public health problem and the most obvious preventive strategy, hormone replacement therapy, has lost favor due to recent findings of the Women's Health Initiative regarding increased risks of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring compound possessing estrogenic activity, is thought to have considerable potential for therapy of osteoporosis. In the present study, resveratrol was found to exhibit bone-protective effects equivalent to those exerted by hormone replacement therapy and decrease the risk of breast cancer in the in vivo and in vitro models. Forkhead proteins were found to be essential for both effects of resveratrol. The bone-protective effect was attributable to induction of bone morphogenetic protein-2 through Src kinase-dependent estrogen receptor activation and FOXA1 is required for resveratrol-induced estrogen receptor-dependent bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression. The tumor-suppressive effects of resveratrol were the consequence of Akt inactivation-mediated FOXO3a nuclear accumulation and activation. Resveratrol is therefore anticipated to be highly effective in management of postmenopausal osteoporosis without an increased risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Epigenetic pathways can regulate gene expression by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.},

abstract = {B cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking promotes proliferation and survival of mature B cells. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase-mediated down-regulation of pro-apoptotic and anti-mitogenic genes such as the Foxo family of transcription factors is an important component of this process. Previously, we demonstrated that BCR signaling decreases expression of transcripts for Foxo1, Foxo3 and Foxo4. We now show that BCR-induced down-regulation of Foxo3 and Foxo4 mRNA expression occurs via distinct mechanisms from those established for Foxo1. While Foxo1, Foxo3 and Foxo4 bind the same DNA sequence, the differential control of their expression upon B cell activation suggests that they may have unique functions in the B lineage. To begin to address this issue, we evaluated B cell development and function in Foxo3-/- mice. No effect of Foxo3 deficiency was observed with respect to the following parameters in the splenic B cell compartment: sub-population distribution, proliferation, in vitro differentiation and expression of the Foxo target genes cyclin G2 and B cell translocation gene 1. However, Foxo3-/- mice demonstrated increased basal levels of IgG2a, IgG3 and IgA. A significant reduction in pre-B cell numbers was also observed in Foxo3-/- bone marrow. Finally, recirculating B cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood were decreased in Foxo3-/- mice, perhaps due to lower than normal expression of receptor for sphingosine-1 phosphate, which mediates egress from lymphoid organs. Thus, Foxo3 makes a unique contribution to B cell development, B cell localization and control of Ig levels.},

abstract = {The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD2-4 inhibitors hold therapeutic promise in preclinical models of hematologic malignancies. However, translation of these data to molecules suitable for clinical development has yet to be accomplished. Herein we expand the mechanistic understanding of BET inhibitors in multiple myeloma by using the chemical probe molecule I-BET151. I-BET151 induces apoptosis and exerts strong antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with contrasting effects on oncogenic MYC and HEXIM1, an inhibitor of the transcriptional activator P-TEFb. I-BET151 causes transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent programs by abrogating recruitment to the chromatin of the P-TEFb component CDK9 in a BRD2-4-dependent manner. In contrast, transcriptional upregulation of HEXIM1 is BRD2-4 independent. Finally, preclinical studies show that I-BET762 has a favorable pharmacologic profile as an oral agent and that it inhibits myeloma cell proliferation, resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma xenograft model. These data provide a strong rationale for extending the clinical testing of the novel antimyeloma agent I-BET762 and reveal insights into biologic pathways required for myeloma cell proliferation.},

abstract = {The clinical course and eventual outcome, or prognosis, of complex diseases varies enormously between affected individuals. This variability critically determines the impact a disease has on a patient's life but is very poorly understood. Here, we exploit existing genome-wide association study data to gain insight into the role of genetics in prognosis. We identify a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A (rs12212067: T {\textgreater} G) at which the minor (G) allele, despite not being associated with disease susceptibility, is associated with a milder course of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis and with increased risk of severe malaria. Minor allele carriage is shown to limit inflammatory responses in monocytes via a FOXO3-driven pathway, which through TGF$\beta$1 reduces production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF$\alpha$, and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10. Thus, we uncover a shared genetic contribution to prognosis in distinct diseases that operates via a FOXO3-driven pathway modulating inflammatory responses.},

@article{Bilancio2006,
abstract = {Mouse gene-targeting studies have documented a central role of the p110delta isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in B-cell development and function. A defect in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is key to this B-cell phenotype. Here we further characterize this signaling defect and report that a p110delta-selective small molecule inhibitor mirrors the effect of genetic inactivation of p110delta in BCR signaling. p110delta activity is indispensable for BCR-induced DNA synthesis and phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), forkhead transcription factor/forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), and p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K), with modest effects on the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3alpha/beta) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). The PI3K-dependent component of intracellular calcium mobilization also completely relies on p110delta catalytic activity. Resting B cells with inactive p110delta fail to enter the cell cycle, correlating with an incapacity to up-regulate the expression of cyclins D2, A, and E, and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). p110delta is also critical for interleukin 4 (IL-4)-induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and FOXO3a, and protection from apoptosis. Taken together, these data show that defects observed in p110delta mutant mice are not merely a consequence of altered B-cell differentiation, and emphasize the potential utility of p110delta as a drug target in autoimmune diseases in which B cells play a crucial role.},

abstract = {The combinatorial cross-regulation of hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) defines a regulatory network that underlies cellular identity and function. Here we use genome-wide maps of in vivo DNaseI footprints to assemble an extensive core human regulatory network comprising connections among 475 sequence-specific TFs and to analyze the dynamics of these connections across 41 diverse cell and tissue types. We find that human TF networks are highly cell selective and are driven by cohorts of factors that include regulators with previously unrecognized roles in control of cellular identity. Moreover, we identify many widely expressed factors that impact transcriptional regulatory networks in a cell-selective manner. Strikingly, in spite of their inherent diversity, all cell-type regulatory networks independently converge on a common architecture that closely resembles the topology of living neuronal networks. Together, our results provide an extensive description of the circuitry, dynamics, and organizing principles of the human TF regulatory network.},

@article{Levison2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to colonic inflammation is poorly defined at the gene level. Although Genome Wide Association studies (GWAS) have identified loci in the human genome which confer susceptibility to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis), it is not clear if precise loci exist which confer susceptibility to inflammation at specific locations within the gut e.g. small versus large intestine. Susceptibility loci for colitis in particular have been defined in the mouse, although specific candidate genes have not been identified to date. We have previously shown that infection with Trichuris muris (T. muris) induces chronic colitis in susceptible mouse strains with clinical, histological, and immunological homology to human colonic Crohn's disease. We performed an integrative analysis of colitis susceptibility, using an F2 inter-cross of resistant (BALB/c) and susceptible (AKR) mice following T. muris infection. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL), polymorphic and expression data were analysed alongside in silico workflow analyses to discover novel candidate genes central to the development and biology of chronic colitis. RESULTS: 7 autosomal QTL regions were associated with the establishment of chronic colitis following infection. 144 QTL genes had parental strain SNPs and significant gene expression changes in chronic colitis (expression fold-change ≥ +/-1.4). The T. muris QTL on chromosome 3 (Tm3) mapped to published QTL in 3 unrelated experimental models of colitis and contained 33 significantly transcribed polymorphic genes. Phenotypic pathway analysis, text mining and time-course qPCR replication highlighted several potential cis-QTL candidate genes in colitis susceptibility, including FcgR1, Ptpn22, RORc, and Vav3. CONCLUSION: Genetic susceptibility to induced colonic mucosal inflammation in the mouse is conserved at Tm3 and overlays Cdcs1.1. Genes central to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis reside within this locus, implicating several candidates in susceptibility to colonic inflammation. Combined methodology incorporating genetic, transcriptional and pathway data allowed identification of biologically relevant candidate genes, with Vav3 newly implicated as a colitis susceptibility gene of functional relevance.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of autoimmune disease-susceptibility genes. Whether or not these loci share any regulatory or functional elements, however, is an open question. Finding such common regulators is of considerable research interest in order to define systemic therapeutic targets. The growing amount of experimental genomic annotations, particularly those from the ENCODE project, provide a wealth of opportunities to search for such commonalities. We hypothesized that regulatory commonalities might not only delineate a regulatory landscape predisposing to autoimmune diseases, but also define functional elements distinguishing specific diseases. We further investigated if, and how, disease-specific epigenomic elements can identify novel genes yet to be associated with the diseases. We evaluated transcription factors, histone modifications, and chromatin state data obtained from the ENCODE project for statistically significant over- or under-representation in the promoters of genes associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). We identified BATF, BCL11A, IRF4, NFkB, PAX5, and PU.1 as transcription factors over-represented in SLE- and RA-susceptibility gene promoters. H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 epigenomic marks were associated with SLE susceptibility genes, and H3K9me3 was common to both SLE and RA. In contrast to a transcriptionally active signature in SLE and RA, SSc-susceptibility genes were depleted in activating epigenomic elements. Using epigenomic elements enriched in SLE and RA, we identified additional immune and B cell signaling-related genes with the same elements in their promoters. Our analysis suggests common and disease-specific epigenomic elements that may define novel therapeutic targets for controlling aberrant activation of autoimmune susceptibility genes.},

In vitro, T cells from patients exhibited increased phosphorylation of the kinase Akt and hyperactivation of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR, enhanced glucose uptake and terminal effector differentiation.

abstract = {SUMMARY: We created a deeply extracted and annotated database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results. GRASP v1.0 contains {\textgreater}6.2 million SNP-phenotype association from among 1390 GWAS studies. We re-annotated GWAS results with 16 annotation sources including some rarely compared to GWAS results (e.g. RNAediting sites, lincRNAs, PTMs). MOTIVATION: To create a high-quality resource to facilitate further use and interpretation of human GWAS results in order to address important scientific questions. RESULTS: GWAS have grown exponentially, with increases in sample sizes and markers tested, and continuing bias toward European ancestry samples. GRASP contains {\textgreater}100 000 phenotypes, roughly: eQTLs (71.5{\%}), metabolite QTLs (21.2{\%}), methylation QTLs (4.4{\%}) and diseases, biomarkers and other traits (2.8{\%}). cis-eQTLs, meQTLs, mQTLs and MHC region SNPs are highly enriched among significant results. After removing these categories, GRASP still contains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable GWAS catalogs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors pre-dominate remaining GWAS results, followed by immunological, neurological and cancer traits. Significant results in GWAS display a highly gene-centric tendency. Sex chromosome X (OR = 0.18[0.16-0.20]) and Y (OR = 0.003[0.001-0.01]) genes are depleted for GWAS results. Gene length is correlated with GWAS results at nominal significance (P ≤ 0.05) levels. We show this gene-length correlation decays at increasingly more stringent P-value thresholds. Potential pleotropic genes and SNPs enriched for multi-phenotype association in GWAS are identified. However, we note possible population stratification at some of these loci. Finally, via re-annotation we identify compelling functional hypotheses at GWAS loci, in some cases unrealized in studies to date. CONCLUSION: Pooling summary-level GWAS results and re-annotating with bioinformatics predictions and molecular features provides a good platform for new insights. AVAILABILITY: The GRASP database is available at http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp.},

The analysis allowed us to establish a framework based on the five most important technical determinants of project success and pipeline quality, which we describe as the five 'R's: the right target, the right patient, the right tissue, the right safety and the right commercial potential. A sixth factor - the right culture - is also crucial in encouraging effective decision-making based on these technical determinants. AstraZeneca is currently applying this framework to guide its R{\&}D teams, and although it is too early to demonstrate whether this has improved the company's R{\&}D productivity, we present our data and analysis here in the hope that it may assist the industry overall in addressing this key challenge.},

abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

abstract = {CD8(+) T cells undergo rapid expansion during infection with intracellular pathogens, which is followed by swift and massive culling of primed CD8(+) T cells. The mechanisms that govern the massive contraction and maintenance of primed CD8(+) T cells are not clear. We show in this study that the transcription factor, FoxO3a, does not influence Ag presentation and the consequent expansion of CD8(+) T cell response during Listeria monocytogenes infection, but plays a key role in the maintenance of memory CD8(+) T cells. The effector function of primed CD8(+) T cells as revealed by cytokine secretion and CD107a degranulation was not influenced by inactivation of FoxO3a. Interestingly, FoxO3a-deficient CD8(+) T cells displayed reduced expression of proapoptotic molecules BIM and PUMA during the various phases of response, and underwent reduced apoptosis in comparison with wild-type cells. A higher number of memory precursor effector cells and memory subsets was detectable in FoxO3a-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, FoxO3a-deficient memory CD8(+) T cells upon transfer into normal or RAG1-deficient mice displayed enhanced survival. These results suggest that FoxO3a acts in a cell-intrinsic manner to regulate the survival of primed CD8(+) T cells.},

abstract = {Bromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, particularly for hematologic malignancies. To date, however, genomic biomarkers to direct clinical translation have been lacking. We conducted a cell-based screen of genetically defined cancer cell lines using a prototypical inhibitor of BET bromodomains. Integration of genetic features with chemosensitivity data revealed a robust correlation between MYCN amplification and sensitivity to bromodomain inhibition. We characterized the mechanistic and translational significance of this finding in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with frequent amplification of MYCN. Genome-wide expression analysis showed downregulation of the MYCN transcriptional program accompanied by suppression of MYCN transcription. Functionally, bromodomain-mediated inhibition of MYCN impaired growth and induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma. BRD4 knockdown phenocopied these effects, establishing BET bromodomains as transcriptional regulators of MYCN. BET inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage in 3 in vivo neuroblastoma models, providing a compelling rationale for developing BET bromodomain inhibitors in patients with neuroblastoma.},

abstract = {Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled us to identify thousands of genetic variants (GVs) that are associated with human diseases. As next-generation sequencing technologies become less expensive, more GVs will be discovered in the near future. Existing databases, such as NHGRI GWAS Catalog, collect GVs with only genome-wide level significance. However, many true disease susceptibility loci have relatively moderate P values and are not included in these databases. We have developed GWASdb that contains 20 times more data than the GWAS Catalog and includes less significant GVs (P {\textless} 1.0 × 10(-3)) manually curated from the literature. In addition, GWASdb provides comprehensive functional annotations for each GV, including genomic mapping information, regulatory effects (transcription factor binding sites, microRNA target sites and splicing sites), amino acid substitutions, evolution, gene expression and disease associations. Furthermore, GWASdb classifies these GVs according to diseases using Disease-Ontology Lite and Human Phenotype Ontology. It can conduct pathway enrichment and PPI network association analysis for these diseases. GWASdb provides an intuitive, multifunctional database for biologists and clinicians to explore GVs and their functional inferences. It is freely available at http://jjwanglab.org/gwasdb and will be updated frequently.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

@article{Hou2014,
abstract = {Although Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified many susceptibility loci for common diseases, they only explain a small portion of heritability. It is challenging to identify the remaining disease loci because their association signals are likely weak and difficult to identify among millions of candidates. One potentially useful direction to increase statistical power is to incorporate functional genomics information, especially gene expression networks, to prioritize GWAS signals. Most current methods utilizing network information to prioritize disease genes are based on the 'guilt by association' principle, in which networks are treated as static, and disease-associated genes are assumed to locate closer with each other than random pairs in the network. In contrast, we propose a novel 'guilt by rewiring' principle. Studying the dynamics of gene networks between controls and patients, this principle assumes that disease genes more likely undergo rewiring in patients, whereas most of the network remains unaffected in disease condition. To demonstrate this principle, we consider the changes of co-expression networks in Crohn's disease patients and controls, and how network dynamics reveals information on disease associations. Our results demonstrate that network rewiring is abundant in the immune system, and disease-associated genes are more likely to be rewired in patients. To integrate this network rewiring feature and GWAS signals, we propose to use the Markov random field framework to integrate network information to prioritize genes. Applications in Crohn's disease and Parkinson's disease show that this framework leads to more replicable results, and implicates potentially disease-associated pathways.},

abstract = {Interaction of pathogens with cells of the immune system results in activation of inflammatory gene expression. This response, although vital for immune defence, is frequently deleterious to the host due to the exaggerated production of inflammatory proteins. The scope of inflammatory responses reflects the activation state of signalling proteins upstream of inflammatory genes as well as signal-induced assembly of nuclear chromatin complexes that support mRNA expression. Recognition of post-translationally modified histones by nuclear proteins that initiate mRNA transcription and support mRNA elongation is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. Here we present a novel pharmacological approach that targets inflammatory gene expression by interfering with the recognition of acetylated histones by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins. We describe a synthetic compound (I-BET) that by 'mimicking' acetylated histones disrupts chromatin complexes responsible for the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages, and confers protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis. Our findings suggest that synthetic compounds specifically targeting proteins that recognize post-translationally modified histones can serve as a new generation of immunomodulatory drugs.},

Circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations predict anthropometric traits and risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. In a genome-wide association study of 10 280 middle-aged and older men and women from four community-based cohort studies, we confirmed a known association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IGFBP3 gene region on chromosome 7p12.3 with IGFBP-3 concentrations using a significance threshold of P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) (P = 3.3 × 10(-101)). Furthermore, the same IGFBP3 gene locus (e.g. rs11977526) that was associated with IGFBP-3 concentrations was also associated with the opposite direction of effect, with IGF-I concentration after adjustment for IGFBP-3 concentration (P = 1.9 × 10(-26)). A novel and independent locus on chromosome 7p12.3 (rs700752) had genome-wide significant associations with higher IGFBP-3 (P = 4.4 × 10(-21)) and higher IGF-I (P = 4.9 × 10(-9)) concentrations; when the two measurements were adjusted for one another, the IGF-I association was attenuated but the IGFBP-3 association was not. Two additional loci demonstrated genome-wide significant associations with IGFBP-3 concentration (rs1065656, chromosome 16p13.3, P = 1.2 × 10(-11), IGFALS, a confirmatory finding; and rs4234798, chromosome 4p16.1, P = 4.5 × 10(-10), SORCS2, a novel finding). Together, the four genome-wide significant loci explained 6.5{\%} of the population variation in IGFBP-3 concentration. Furthermore, we observed a borderline statistically significant association between IGF-I concentration and FOXO3 (rs2153960, chromosome 6q21, P = 5.1 × 10(-7)), a locus associated with longevity. These genetic loci deserve further investigation to elucidate the biological basis for the observed associations and clarify their possible role in IGF-mediated regulation of cell growth and metabolism.},

abstract = {Accelerated lung function decline is a key COPD phenotype; however, its genetic control remains largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study using the Illumina Human660W-Quad v.1{\_}A BeadChip. Generalized estimation equations were used to assess genetic contributions to lung function decline over a 5-year period in 4,048 European American Lung Health Study participants with largely mild COPD. Genotype imputation was performed using reference HapMap II data. To validate regions meeting genome-wide significance, replication of top SNPs was attempted in independent cohorts. Three genes (TMEM26, ANK3 and FOXA1) within the regions of interest were selected for tissue expression studies using immunohistochemistry. Two intergenic SNPs (rs10761570, rs7911302) on chromosome 10 and one SNP on chromosome 14 (rs177852) met genome-wide significance after Bonferroni. Further support for the chromosome 10 region was obtained by imputation, the most significantly associated imputed SNPs (rs10761571, rs7896712) being flanked by observed markers rs10761570 and rs7911302. Results were not replicated in four general population cohorts or a smaller cohort of subjects with moderate to severe COPD; however, we show novel expression of genes near regions of significantly associated SNPS, including TMEM26 and FOXA1 in airway epithelium and lung parenchyma, and ANK3 in alveolar macrophages. Levels of expression were associated with lung function and COPD status. We identified two novel regions associated with lung function decline in mild COPD. Genes within these regions were expressed in relevant lung cells and their expression related to airflow limitation suggesting they may represent novel candidate genes for COPD susceptibility.},

A number of innovative approaches for pursuing this goal have evolved, and the right approach is dictated by the target class being pursued and the capabilities of the organization involved. A recent trend in high-throughput screening has been to place less emphasis on the number of data points that can be produced, and to focus instead on the quality of the data obtained. Several computational and technological advances have aided in the selection of compounds for screening and widened the variety of assay formats available for screening.

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

However, the specific genes responsible for enhanced risk or host differences in susceptibility to smoke exposure remain poorly understood. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive literature overview on the genetics of COPD, highlight the most promising findings during the last few years, and ultimately provide an updated COPD gene list. Candidate gene studies on COPD and related phenotypes indexed in PubMed before January 5, 2012 are tabulated. An exhaustive list of publications for any given gene was looked for. This well-documented COPD candidate-gene list is expected to serve many purposes for future replication studies and meta-analyses as well as for reanalyzing collected genomic data in the field. In addition, this review summarizes recent genetic loci identified by genome-wide association studies on COPD, lung function, and related complications. Assembling resources, integrative genomic approaches, and large sample sizes of well-phenotyped subjects is part of the path forward to elucidate the genetic basis of this debilitating disease.},

abstract = {Cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genome-wide association studies have provided compelling associations for three loci with COPD. In this study, we aimed to estimate direct, i.e., independent from smoking, and indirect effects of those loci on COPD development using mediation analysis. We included a total of 3,424 COPD cases and 1,872 unaffected controls with data on two smoking-related phenotypes: lifetime average smoking intensity and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke (pack years). Our analysis revealed that effects of two linked variants (rs1051730 and rs8034191) in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development are significantly, yet not entirely, mediated by the smoking-related phenotypes. Approximately 30{\%} of the total effect of variants in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development was mediated by pack years. Simultaneous analysis of modestly (r (2) = 0.21) linked markers in CHRNA3 and IREB2 revealed that an even larger ({\~{}}42{\%}) proportion of the total effect of the CHRNA3 locus on COPD was mediated by pack years after adjustment for an IREB2 single nucleotide polymorphism. This study confirms the existence of direct effects of the AGPHD1/CHRNA3, IREB2, FAM13A and HHIP loci on COPD development. While the association of the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 locus with COPD is significantly mediated by smoking-related phenotypes, IREB2 appears to affect COPD independently of smoking.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Airway inflammation is a central feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD exacerbations are often triggered by rhinovirus (RV) infection. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that airway epithelial cells from patients with COPD maintain a proinflammatory phenotype compared with control subjects, leading to greater RV responses. METHODS: Cells were isolated from tracheobronchial tissues of 12 patients with COPD and 10 transplant donors. Eight patients with COPD had severe emphysema, three had mild to moderate emphysema, and one had no emphysema. All had moderate to severe airflow obstruction, and six met criteria for chronic bronchitis or had at least one exacerbation the previous year. Cells were grown at air-liquid interface and infected with RV serotype 39. Cytokine and IFN expression was measured by ELISA. Selected genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolysis were assessed by focused gene array and real-time polymerase chain reaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, cells from patients with COPD demonstrated increased mRNA expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and the response to viral infection, including NOX1, DUOXA2, MMP12, ICAM1, DDX58/RIG-I, STAT1, and STAT2. COPD cells showed elevated baseline and RV-stimulated protein levels of IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and growth-related oncogene-alpha/CXCL1. COPD cells demonstrated increased viral titer and copy number after RV infection, despite increased IL-29/IFN-lambda1, IL-28A/IFN-lambda2, and IFN-inducible protein-10/CXCL10 protein levels. Finally, RV-infected COPD cultures showed increased mRNA expression of IL28A/IFNlambda2, IL29/IFNlambda1, IFIH1/MDA5, DDX58/RIG-I, DUOX1, DUOX2, IRF7, STAT1, and STAT2. CONCLUSIONS: Airway epithelial cells from patients with COPD show higher baseline levels of cytokine expression and increased susceptibility to RV infection, despite an increased IFN response.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci influencing lung function, but fewer genes influencing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are known. OBJECTIVES: Perform meta-analyses of GWAS for airflow obstruction, a key pathophysiologic characteristic of COPD assessed by spirometry, in population-based cohorts examining all participants, ever smokers, never smokers, asthma-free participants, and more severe cases. METHODS: Fifteen cohorts were studied for discovery (3,368 affected; 29,507 unaffected), and a population-based family study and a meta-analysis of case-control studies were used for replication and regional follow-up (3,837 cases; 4,479 control subjects). Airflow obstruction was defined as FEV(1) and its ratio to FVC (FEV(1)/FVC) both less than their respective lower limits of normal as determined by published reference equations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The discovery meta-analyses identified one region on chromosome 15q25.1 meeting genome-wide significance in ever smokers that includes AGPHD1, IREB2, and CHRNA5/CHRNA3 genes. The region was also modestly associated among never smokers. Gene expression studies confirmed the presence of CHRNA5/3 in lung, airway smooth muscle, and bronchial epithelial cells. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in HTR4, a gene previously related to FEV(1)/FVC, achieved genome-wide statistical significance in combined meta-analysis. Top single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ADAM19, RARB, PPAP2B, and ADAMTS19 were nominally replicated in the COPD meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for the CHRNA5/3 region as a genetic risk factor for airflow obstruction that may be independent of smoking and implicate the HTR4 gene in the etiology of airflow obstruction.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with chronic inflammation of the peripheral airways and lung parenchyma, which leads to progressive obstruction of the airways. Current management with long-acting bronchodilators does not reduce disease progression, and there are no treatments that effectively suppress chronic inflammation in COPD. An increased understanding of the inflammatory processes that are involved in the pathophysiology of COPD has identified several new therapeutic targets. This Review discusses some of the most promising of these targets, including new antioxidants, kinase inhibitors and drugs that target cellular senescence, microbial colonization, epigenetic regulation of inflammatory gene expression and corticosteroid resistance.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Molecular phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been impeded in part by the difficulty in obtaining lung tissue samples from individuals with impaired lung function. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether COPD-associated processes are reflected in gene expression profiles of bronchial airway epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopy. METHODS: Gene expression profiling of bronchial brushings obtained from 238 current and former smokers with and without COPD was performed using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 98 genes whose expression levels were associated with COPD status, FEV1{\%} predicted, and FEV1/FVC. In silico analysis identified activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a potential transcriptional regulator of genes with COPD-associated airway expression, and ATF4 overexpression in airway epithelial cells in vitro recapitulates COPD-associated gene expression changes. Genes with COPD-associated expression in the bronchial airway epithelium had similarly altered expression profiles in prior studies performed on small-airway epithelium and lung parenchyma, suggesting that transcriptomic alterations in the bronchial airway epithelium reflect molecular events found at more distal sites of disease activity. Many of the airway COPD-associated gene expression changes revert toward baseline after therapy with the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone in independent cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a molecular field of injury throughout the bronchial airway of active and former smokers with COPD that may be driven in part by ATF4 and is modifiable with therapy. Bronchial airway epithelium may ultimately serve as a relatively accessible tissue in which to measure biomarkers of disease activity for guiding clinical management of COPD.},

abstract = {If trait-associated variants alter regulatory regions, then they should fall within chromatin marks in relevant cell types. However, it is unclear which of the many marks are most useful in defining cell types associated with disease and fine mapping variants. We hypothesized that informative marks are phenotypically cell type specific; that is, SNPs associated with the same trait likely overlap marks in the same cell type. We examined 15 chromatin marks and found that those highlighting active gene regulation were phenotypically cell type specific. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) was the most phenotypically cell type specific (P {\textless} 1 × 10(-6)), driven by colocalization of variants and marks rather than gene proximity (P {\textless} 0.001). H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with 37 SNPs for plasma low-density lipoprotein concentration in the liver (P {\textless} 7 × 10(-5)), 31 SNPs for rheumatoid arthritis within CD4(+) regulatory T cells (P = 1 × 10(-4)), 67 SNPs for type 2 diabetes in pancreatic islet cells (P = 0.003) and the liver (P = 0.003), and 14 SNPs for neuropsychiatric disease in neuronal tissues (P = 0.007). We show how cell type-specific H3K4me3 peaks can inform the fine mapping of associated SNPs to identify causal variation.},

The main cause is smoking tobacco, but other factors have been identified. Several pathobiological processes interact on a complex background of genetic determinants, lung growth, and environmental stimuli. The disease is further aggravated by exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe disease, up to 78{\%} of which are due to bacterial infections, viral infections, or both. Comorbidities include ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. Bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of treatment: $\beta$(2) agonists and long-acting anticholinergic agents are frequently used (the former often with inhaled corticosteroids). Besides improving symptoms, these treatments are also thought to lead to some degree of disease modification. Future research should be directed towards the development of agents that notably affect the course of disease.},

To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of limited size have identified several novel risk loci for COPD at CHRNA3/CHRNA5/IREB2, HHIP and FAM13A; additional loci may be identified through larger studies. We performed a GWAS using a total of 3499 cases and 1922 control subjects from four cohorts: the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE); the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT); Bergen, Norway (GenKOLS); and the COPDGene study. Genotyping was performed on Illumina platforms with additional markers imputed using 1000 Genomes data; results were summarized using fixed-effect meta-analysis. We identified a new genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 19q13 (rs7937, OR = 0.74, P = 2.9 × 10(-9)). Genotyping this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and another nearby SNP in linkage disequilibrium (rs2604894) in 2859 subjects from the family-based International COPD Genetics Network study (ICGN) demonstrated supportive evidence for association for COPD (P = 0.28 and 0.11 for rs7937 and rs2604894), pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) (P = 0.08 and 0.04) and severe (GOLD 3{\&}4) COPD (P = 0.09 and 0.017).

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a large number of phenotypes. However, an associated SNP is likely part of a larger region of linkage disequilibrium. This makes it difficult to precisely identify the SNPs that have a biological link with the phenotype. We have systematically investigated the association of multiple types of ENCODE data with disease-associated SNPs and show that there is significant enrichment for functional SNPs among the currently identified associations. This enrichment is strongest when integrating multiple sources of functional information and when highest confidence disease-associated SNPs are used. We propose an approach that integrates multiple types of functional data generated by the ENCODE Consortium to help identify "functional SNPs" that may be associated with the disease phenotype. Our approach generates putative functional annotations for up to 80{\%} of all previously reported associations. We show that for most associations, the functional SNP most strongly supported by experimental evidence is a SNP in linkage disequilibrium with the reported association rather than the reported SNP itself. Our results show that the experimental data sets generated by the ENCODE Consortium can be successfully used to suggest functional hypotheses for variants associated with diseases and other phenotypes.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for circulating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) biomarkers could identify genetic determinants of biomarker levels and COPD susceptibility. OBJECTIVES: To identify genetic variants of circulating protein biomarkers and novel genetic determinants of COPD. METHODS: GWAS was performed for two pneumoproteins, Clara cell secretory protein (CC16) and surfactant protein D (SP-D), and five systemic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$) in 1,951 subjects with COPD. For genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P {\textless} 1 × 10(-8)), association with COPD susceptibility was tested in 2,939 cases with COPD and 1,380 smoking control subjects. The association of candidate SNPs with mRNA expression in induced sputum was also elucidated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Genome-wide significant susceptibility loci affecting biomarker levels were found only for the two pneumoproteins. Two discrete loci affecting CC16, one region near the CC16 coding gene (SCGB1A1) on chromosome 11 and another locus approximately 25 Mb away from SCGB1A1, were identified, whereas multiple SNPs on chromosomes 6 and 16, in addition to SNPs near SFTPD, had genome-wide significant associations with SP-D levels. Several SNPs affecting circulating CC16 levels were significantly associated with sputum mRNA expression of SCGB1A1 (P = 0.009-0.03). Several SNPs highly associated with CC16 or SP-D levels were nominally associated with COPD in a collaborative GWAS (P = 0.001-0.049), although these COPD associations were not replicated in two additional cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Distant genetic loci and biomarker-coding genes affect circulating levels of COPD-related pneumoproteins. A subset of these protein quantitative trait loci may influence their gene expression in the lung and/or COPD susceptibility. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00292552).},

abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are increasingly used to tag genetic loci associated with phenotypes such as risk of complex diseases. Technically, this is done genome-wide without prior restriction or knowledge of biological feasibility in scans referred to as genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Depending on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure at a particular locus, such tagSNPs may be surrogates for many thousands of other SNPs, and it is difficult to distinguish those that may play a functional role in the phenotype from those simply genetically linked. Because a large proportion of tagSNPs have been identified within non-coding regions of the genome, distinguishing functional from non-functional SNPs has been an even greater challenge. A strategy was recently proposed that prioritizes surrogate SNPs based on non-coding chromatin and epigenomic mapping techniques that have become feasible with the advent of massively parallel sequencing. Here, we introduce an R/Bioconductor software package that enables the identification of candidate functional SNPs by integrating information from tagSNP locations, lists of linked SNPs from the 1000 genomes project and locations of chromatin features which may have functional significance. Availability: FunciSNP is available from Bioconductor (bioconductor.org).},

abstract = {The identification of small-molecule modulators of protein function, and the process of transforming these into high-content lead series, are key activities in modern drug discovery. The decisions taken during this process have far-reaching consequences for success later in lead optimization and even more crucially in clinical development. Recently, there has been an increased focus on these activities due to escalating downstream costs resulting from high clinical failure rates. In addition, the vast emerging opportunities from efforts in functional genomics and proteomics demands a departure from the linear process of identification, evaluation and refinement activities towards a more integrated parallel process. This calls for flexible, fast and cost-effective strategies to meet the demands of producing high-content lead series with improved prospects for clinical success.},

@article{Perino2011,
abstract = {Adrenergic stimulation of the heart engages cAMP and phosphoinositide second messenger signaling cascades. Cardiac phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110$\gamma$ participates in these processes by sustaining $\beta$-adrenergic receptor internalization through its catalytic function and by controlling phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) activity via an unknown kinase-independent mechanism. We have discovered that p110$\gamma$ anchors protein kinase A (PKA) through a site in its N-terminal region. Anchored PKA activates PDE3B to enhance cAMP degradation and phosphorylates p110$\gamma$ to inhibit PIP(3) production. This provides local feedback control of PIP(3) and cAMP signaling events. In congestive heart failure, p110$\gamma$ is upregulated and escapes PKA-mediated inhibition, contributing to a reduction in $\beta$-adrenergic receptor density. Pharmacological inhibition of p110$\gamma$ normalizes $\beta$-adrenergic receptor density and improves contractility in failing hearts.},
