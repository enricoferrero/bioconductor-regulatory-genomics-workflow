abstract = {We are in a phase of unprecedented progress in identifying genetic loci that cause variation in traits ranging from growth and fitness in simple organisms to disease in humans. However, a mechanistic understanding of how these loci influence traits is lacking for the majority of loci. Studies of the genetics of gene expression have emerged as a key tool for linking DNA sequence variation to phenotypes. Here, we review recent insights into the molecular nature of regulatory variants and describe their influence on the transcriptome and the proteome. We discuss conceptual advances from studies in model organisms and present examples of complete chains of causality that link individual polymorphisms to changes in gene expression, which in turn result in physiological changes and, ultimately, disease risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria in classifying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in an uncontrolled real-life scenario. METHODS Chart review study was performed in which each criterion from the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the 2012 SLICC criteria to classify SLE was applied to patients from an outpatient rheumatology clinic. The clinical diagnosis was used as the gold standard. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of the 2012 SLICC criteria were 92{\%} and 99{\%}, respectively, compared with the 1997 ACR criteria, which were 97{\%} and 99{\%}, respectively. The 2012 SLICC criteria were similar to the 1997 ACR criteria in terms of positive (98.9{\%} versus 99{\%}) and negative (92.5{\%} versus 97.1{\%}) predictive values as well as positive (92 versus 97) and negative (0.08 versus 0.03) likelihood ratios. A concordance of 0.96 (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] 0.92–1.00) was observed between clinical diagnosis and the 1997 ACR criteria, while the concordance was 0.91 (95{\%} CI 0.85–0.97) for the 2012 SLICC criteria. Seven SLE patients classified by the 1997 ACR criteria did not meet the 2012 SLICC criteria because of either the new definition for lymphopenia (2 patients) or the presence of isolated cutaneous involvement (5 patients), while 2 SLE patients who were classified by the 2012 SLICC criteria did not meet the 1997 ACR criteria because of either the presence of erosive arthritis or biopsy-proven nephritis with circulating antinuclear antibodies. CONCLUSION Overall, the 1997 ACR and the 2012 SLICC criteria are similar to classify SLE in an uncontrolled real-life scenario, although several new items contained in the 2012 SLICC criteria could represent a step forward for research purposes in selected clinical settings.},

Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were often selected for validation based on their functional annotation, which was inadequate and biased. We propose to use the more than 200,000 microarray studies in the Gene Expression Omnibus to systematically prioritize candidate SNPs from GWASs. RESULTS We analyzed all human microarray studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and calculated the observed frequency of differential expression, which we called differential expression ratio, for every human gene. Analysis conducted in a comprehensive list of curated disease genes revealed a positive association between differential expression ratio values and the likelihood of harboring disease-associated variants. By considering highly differentially expressed genes, we were able to rediscover disease genes with 79{\%} specificity and 37{\%} sensitivity. We successfully distinguished true disease genes from false positives in multiple GWASs for multiple diseases. We then derived a list of functionally interpolating SNPs (fitSNPs) to analyze the top seven loci of Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium type 1 diabetes mellitus GWASs, rediscovered all type 1 diabetes mellitus genes, and predicted a novel gene (KIAA1109) for an unexplained locus 4q27. We suggest that fitSNPs would work equally well for both Mendelian and complex diseases (being more effective for cancer) and proposed candidate genes to sequence for their association with 597 syndromes with unknown molecular basis. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that highly differentially expressed genes are more likely to harbor disease-associated DNA variants. FitSNPs can serve as an effective tool to systematically prioritize candidate SNPs from GWASs.},

The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools.

abstract = {A20 is a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger protein which is induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli and which has been characterized as an inhibitor of cell death by a yet unknown mechanism. In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with A20. A cDNA fragment was isolated which encoded a portion of a novel protein (TXBP151), which was recently found to be a human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) Tax-binding protein. The full-length 2386 bp TXBP151 mRNA encodes a protein of 86 kDa. Like A20, overexpression of TXBP151 could inhibit apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, transfection of antisense TXBP151 partially abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of A20. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by TNF or CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was associated with proteolysis of TXBP151. This degradation could be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or by expression of the cowpox virus-derived inhibitor CrmA, suggesting that TXBP151 is a novel substrate for caspase family members. TXBP151 was indeed found to be specifically cleaved in vitro by members of the caspase-3-like subfamily, viz. caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7. Thus TXBP151 appears to be a novel A20-binding protein which might mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of A20, and which can be processed by specific caspases.},

Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly 'housekeeping', whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses.

abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of functional elements in the human genome will require thorough interrogation and comparison of individual human genomes and genomic structures. Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its associated premature vascular damage. No drug to date targets both systemic inflammatory disease and the cardiovascular complications of SLE. Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that blocks signaling downstream of multiple cytokines implicated in lupus pathogenesis. While clinical trials have shown that tofacitinib exhibits significant clinical efficacy in various autoimmune diseases, its role in SLE and the associated vascular pathology remains to be characterized. METHODS MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice were administered tofacitinib or vehicle by gavage for 6 weeks (therapeutic arm) or 8 weeks (preventive arm). Nephritis, skin inflammation, serum levels of autoantibodies and cytokines, mononuclear cell phenotype and gene expression, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and endothelial differentiation were compared in treated and untreated mice. RESULTS Treatment with tofacitinib led to significant improvement in measures of disease activity, including nephritis, skin inflammation, and autoantibody production. In addition, tofacitinib treatment reduced serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon responses in splenocytes and kidney tissue. Tofacitinib also modulated the formation of NETs and significantly increased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and endothelial differentiation. The drug was effective in both preventive and therapeutic strategies. CONCLUSION Tofacitinib modulates the innate and adaptive immune responses, ameliorates murine lupus, and improves vascular function. These results indicate that JAK inhibitors have the potential to be beneficial in SLE and its associated vascular damage.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

We leverage expression imputation from genetic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify significant expression-trait associations. We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in ∼ 3,000 individuals overall. We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height). Many of these genes are associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Precise quantitative and spatiotemporal control of gene expression is necessary to ensure proper cellular differentiation and the maintenance of homeostasis. The relationship between gene expression and the spatial organisation of chromatin is highly complex, interdependent and not completely understood. The development of experimental techniques to interrogate both the higher-order structure of chromatin and the interactions between regulatory elements has recently lead to important insights on how gene expression is controlled. The ability to gain these and future insights is critically dependent on computational tools for the analysis and visualisation of data produced by these techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION We have developed GenomicInteractions, a freely available R/Bioconductor package designed for processing, analysis and visualisation of data generated from various types of chromosome conformation capture experiments. The package allows the easy annotation and summarisation of large genome-wide datasets at both the level of individual interactions and sets of genomic features, and provides several different methods for interrogating and visualising this type of data. We demonstrate this package's utility by showing example analyses performed on interaction datasets generated using Hi-C and ChIA-PET.},

Ro60 deletion resulted in enhanced expression of Alu RNAs and interferon-regulated genes.

Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role.

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect many organs, including the skin, joints, the central nervous system and the kidneys. Women of childbearing age and certain racial groups are typically predisposed to developing the condition. Rare, inherited, single-gene complement deficiencies are strongly associated with SLE, but the disease is inherited in a polygenic manner in most patients. Genetic interactions with environmental factors, particularly UV light exposure, Epstein-Barr virus infection and hormonal factors, might initiate the disease, resulting in immune dysregulation at the level of cytokines, T cells, B cells and macrophages. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of SLE. Classification criteria have aided clinical trials, but, despite this, only one drug (that is, belimumab) has been approved for use in SLE in the past 60 years. The 10-year mortality has improved and toxic adverse effects of older medications such as cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids have been partially offset by newer drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoid-sparing regimes. However, further improvements have been hampered by the adverse effects of renal and neuropsychiatric involvement and late diagnosis. Adding to this burden is the increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease in SLE together with the risk of infection made worse by immunosuppressive therapy. Challenges remain with treatment-resistant disease and symptoms such as fatigue. Newer therapies may bring hope of better outcomes, and the refinement to stem cell and genetic techniques might offer a cure in the future.},

abstract = {The complement system plays a major role in the autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the role of complement in SLE is complex since it may both prevent and exacerbate the disease. In this review, we explore the latest findings in complement-focused research in SLE. C1q deficiency is the strongest genetic risk factor for SLE, although such deficiency is very rare. Various recently discovered genetic associations include mutations in the complement receptors 2 and 3 as well as complement inhibitors, the latter related to earlier onset of nephritis. Further, autoantibodies are a distinct feature of SLE that are produced as the result of an adaptive immune response and how complement can affect that response is also being reviewed. SLE generates numerous disease manifestations involving contributions from complement such as glomerulonephritis and the increased risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, since most of the complement system is present in plasma, complement is very accessible and may be suitable as biomarker for diagnosis or monitoring of disease activity. This review highlights the many roles of complement for SLE pathogenesis and how research has progressed during recent years.},

This interaction occurs between the coiled-coil region of T6BP and the N-terminal ring finger and zinc finger domains of TRAF6. IL-1, but not tumor necrosis factor, induces TRAF6-T6BP complex formation in a ligand-dependent manner. Formation of the TRAF6-T6BP complex depends on the presence of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). After IL-1 stimulation, TRAF6 can exist in two separate complexes, TRAF6-IRAK or TRAF6-T6BP, but IRAK is not present in TRAF6-T6BP complexes. T6BP does not seem to play a direct role in activation of IkappaB kinases or Jun N-terminal kinase.},

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a remarkably complex and heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease. Disease complexity within individuals and heterogeneity among individuals, even genetically identical individuals, is driven by stochastic execution of a complex inherited program. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have progressively improved understanding of which genes are most critical to the potential for SLE and provided illuminating insight about the immune mechanisms that are engaged in SLE. What initiates expression of the genetic program to cause SLE within an individual and how that program is initiated remains poorly understood. If we extrapolate from all of the different experimental mouse models for SLE, we can begin to appreciate why SLE is so heterogeneous and consequently why prediction of disease outcome is so difficult. In this review, we critically evaluate extrinsic versus intrinsic cellular functions in the clearance and elimination of cellular debris and how dysfunction in that system may promote autoimmunity to nuclear antigens. We also examine several mouse models genetically prone to SLE either because of natural inheritance or inheritance of induced mutations to illustrate how different immune mechanisms may initiate autoimmunity and affect disease pathogenesis. Finally, we describe the heterogeneity of disease manifestations in SLE and discuss the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis with emphasis on glomerulonephritis. Particular attention is given to discussion of how anti-DNA autoantibody initiates experimental lupus nephritis (LN) in mice.},

Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

We identify over 1.6 million shared and cell type-restricted interactions spanning hundreds of kilobases between promoters and distal loci. Transcriptionally active genes contact enhancer-like elements, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes interact with previously uncharacterized elements marked by repressive features that may act as long-range silencers. Finally, we show that interacting loci are enriched for disease-associated SNPs, suggesting how distal mutations may disrupt the regulation of relevant genes. This study provides new insights and accessible tools to dissect the regulatory interactions that underlie normal and aberrant gene regulation.},

Although genetic variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is associated with SLE, its role in the development of clinical manifestations and autoantibody production is not well defined. We conducted a meta-analysis of four independent European SLE case collections for associations between SLE sub-phenotypes and MHC single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and variant HLA amino acids. Of the 11 American College of Rheumatology criteria and 7 autoantibody sub-phenotypes examined, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibody subsets exhibited the highest number and most statistically significant associations. HLA-DRB1*03:01 was significantly associated with both sub-phenotypes. We found evidence of associations independent of MHC class II variants in the anti-Ro subset alone. Conditional analyses showed that anti-Ro and anti-La subsets are independently associated with HLA-DRB1*0301, and that the HLA-DRB1*03:01 association with SLE is largely but not completely driven by the association of this allele with these sub-phenotypes. Our results provide strong evidence for a multilevel risk model for HLA-DRB1*03:01 in SLE, where the association with anti-Ro and anti-La antibody-positive SLE is much stronger than SLE without these autoantibodies.},

Growing insight into genes that influence human disease may affect how drug targets and indications are selected. However, there is little guidance about how much weight should be given to genetic evidence in making these key decisions. To answer this question, we investigated how well the current archive of genetic evidence predicts drug mechanisms. We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0{\%} at the preclinical stage to 8.2{\%} among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development. Therefore, using the growing wealth of human genetic data to select the best targets and indications should have a measurable impact on the successful development of new drugs.},

The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences.

abstract = {SUMMARY It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease involving most immune cells. Studies in both experimental animal models of lupus and patients with SLE have revealed a number of cytokine pathways that are important in the disease process. Among these are B-cell activating factor, which promotes B-cell survival and autoantibody production, interferon-alpha, which acts as an immune adjuvant, and tumor necrosis factor, which contributes to organ inflammation. This knowledge, in combination with the successful use of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, has spurred the development of several biologic agents targeting different cytokines or their receptors in SLE. Consequently, many trials of anticytokine therapies for SLE are underway. Although most of these trials are small or in early phases, the results of some large studies have also been reported. In this Review, we discuss the rationale for anticytokine therapies in SLE and review agents currently in use, and those being developed and tested experimentally. We present the results from published trials and discuss the tentative conclusions that can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the new agents. Finally, we provide suggestions for the future of treatment for SLE, including new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Summary We developed the STOPGAP (Systematic Target OPportunity assessment by Genetic Association Predictions) database, an extensive catalog of human genetic associations mapped to effector gene candidates. STOPGAP draws on a variety of publicly available GWAS associations, linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures, functional genomic and variant annotation sources. Algorithms were developed to merge the association data, partition associations into non-overlapping LD clusters, map variants to genes and produce a variant-to-gene score used to rank the relative confidence among potential effector genes. This database can be used for a multitude of investigations into the genes and genetic mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation in human traits, as well as supporting drug discovery applications. Availability and implementation Shell, R, Perl and Python scripts and STOPGAP R data files (version 2.5.1 at publication) are available at https://github.com/StatGenPRD/STOPGAP .

Different polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications lead to altered gene expression and function of several molecules which lead to abnormal T cell responses. Metabolic and functional alterations result in peripheral tolerance failures and biased differentiation of T cells into pro-inflammatory and B cell-helper phenotypes as well as the accumulation of disease-promoting memory T cells. Understanding these T cell alterations and their origins is necessary to develop more accurate patient classification systems and to discover new therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

abstract = {Association studies provide genome-wide information about the genetic basis of complex disease, but medical research has focused primarily on protein-coding variants, owing to the difficulty of interpreting noncoding mutations. This picture has changed with advances in the systematic annotation of functional noncoding elements. Evolutionary conservation, functional genomics, chromatin state, sequence motifs and molecular quantitative trait loci all provide complementary information about the function of noncoding sequences. These functional maps can help with prioritizing variants on risk haplotypes, filtering mutations encountered in the clinic and performing systems-level analyses to reveal processes underlying disease associations. Advances in predictive modeling can enable data-set integration to reveal pathways shared across loci and alleles, and richer regulatory models can guide the search for epistatic interactions. Lastly, new massively parallel reporter experiments can systematically validate regulatory predictions. Ultimately, advances in regulatory and systems genomics can help unleash the value of whole-genome sequencing for personalized genomic risk assessment, diagnosis and treatment.},

Attempts to reduce the number of efficacy- and safety-related failures by analysing possible links to the physicochemical properties of small-molecule drug candidates have been inconclusive because of the limited size of data sets from individual companies. Here, we describe the compilation and analysis of combined data on the attrition of drug candidates from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The analysis reaffirms that control of physicochemical properties during compound optimization is beneficial in identifying compounds of candidate drug quality and indicates for the first time a link between the physicochemical properties of compounds and clinical failure due to safety issues. The results also suggest that further control of physicochemical properties is unlikely to have a significant effect on attrition rates and that additional work is required to address safety-related failures. Further cross-company collaborations will be crucial to future progress in this area.},

@article{Zhang2013,
abstract = {In multicellular organisms, transcription regulation is one of the central mechanisms modelling lineage differentiation and cell-fate determination. Transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations between promoters and their corresponding distal regulatory elements. It is believed that their communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases termed transcription factories in three-dimensional nuclear space. However, the dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been characterized at the genome-wide level. Here, through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tagging approach using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre-initiation complexes of RNA polymerase II, we explore the transcriptional interactomes of three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment, including pluripotent embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and neurosphere stem/progenitor cells. Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40,000 long-range interactions, suggest precise enhancer-promoter associations and delineate cell-type-specific chromatin structures. Analysis of the complex regulatory repertoire shows that there are extensive colocalizations among promoters and distal-acting enhancers. Most of the enhancers associate with promoters located beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that the linear juxtaposition is not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection. Although promoter-enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity, promoters involved in interactions are found to be generally common and mostly active among different cells. Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other in embryonic stem cells, linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene expression. Our study sets the stage for the full-scale dissection of spatial and temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development.},
